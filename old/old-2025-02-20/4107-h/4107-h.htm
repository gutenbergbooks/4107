    <h2>
      INTRODUCTORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      O civilized humanity, world-wide, and especially to the descendants of the
      Pilgrims who, in 1620, laid on New England shores the foundations of that
      civil and religious freedom upon which has been built a refuge for the
      oppressed of every land, the story of the Pilgrim &ldquo;Exodus&rdquo; has an
      ever-increasing value and zest. The little we know of the inception,
      development, and vicissitudes of their bold scheme of colonization in the
      American wilderness only serves to sharpen the appetite for more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every detail and circumstance which relates to their preparations; to the
      ships which carried them; to the personnel of the Merchant Adventurers
      associated with them, and to that of the colonists themselves; to what
      befell them; to their final embarkation on their lone ship,&mdash;the
      immortal MAY-FLOWER; and to the voyage itself and to its issues, is vested
      to-day with, a supreme interest, and over them all rests a glamour
      peculiarly their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      For every grain of added knowledge that can be gleaned concerning the
      Pilgrim sires from any field, their children are ever grateful, and
      whoever can add a well-attested line to their all-too-meagre annals is
      regarded by them, indeed by all, a benefactor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of those all-important factors in the chronicles of the &ldquo;Exodus,&rdquo;&mdash;the
      Pilgrim ships, of which the MAY-FLOWER alone crossed the seas,&mdash;and
      of the voyage itself, there is still but far too little known. Of even
      this little, the larger part has not hitherto been readily accessible, or
      in form available for ready reference to the many who eagerly seize upon
      every crumb of new-found data concerning these pious and intrepid
      Argonauts.
    </p>
    <p>
      To such there can be no need to recite here the principal and familiar
      facts of the organization of the English &ldquo;Separatist&rdquo; congregation under
      John Robinson; of its emigration to Holland under persecution of the
      Bishops; of its residence and unique history at Leyden; of the broad
      outlook of its members upon the future, and their resultant determination
      to cross the sea to secure larger life and liberty; and of their initial
      labors to that end. We find these Leyden Pilgrims in the early summer of
      1620, their plans fairly matured and their agreements between themselves
      and with their merchant associates practically concluded, urging forward
      their preparations for departure; impatient of the delays and
      disappointments which befell, and anxiously seeking shipping for their
      long and hazardous voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to what concerns their ships, and especially that one which has
      passed into history as &ldquo;the Pilgrim bark,&rdquo; the MAY-FLOWER, and to her
      pregnant voyage, that the succeeding chapters chiefly relate. In them the
      effort has been made to bring together in sequential relation, from many
      and widely scattered sources, everything germane that diligent and
      faithful research could discover, or the careful study and re-analysis of
      known data determine. No new and relevant item of fact discovered, however
      trivial in itself, has failed of mention, if it might serve to correct, to
      better interpret, or to amplify the scanty though priceless records left
      us, of conditions, circumstances, and events which have meant so much to
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As properly antecedent to the story of the voyage of the MAY-FLOWER as
      told by her putative &ldquo;Log,&rdquo; albeit written up long after her boned lay
      bleaching on some unknown shore, some pertinent account has been given of
      the ship herself and of her &ldquo;consort,&rdquo; the SPEEDWELL; of the difficulties
      attendant on securing them; of the preparations for the voyage; of the
      Merchant Adventurers who had large share in sending them to sea; of their
      officers and crews; of their passengers and lading; of the troubles that
      assailed before they had &ldquo;shaken off the land,&rdquo; and of the final
      consolidation of the passengers and lading of both ships upon the
      MAY-FLOWER, for the belated ocean passage. The wholly negative results of
      careful search render it altogether probable that the original journal or
      &ldquo;Log&rdquo; of the MAY-FLOWER (a misnomer lately applied by the British press,
      and unhappily continued in that of the United States, to the recovered
      original manuscript of Bradford&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Plimoth Plantation &ldquo;), if
      such journal ever existed, is now hopelessly lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as known, no previous effort has been made to bring together in the
      consecutive relation of such a journal, duly attested and in their
      entirety, the ascertained daily happenings of that destiny-freighted
      voyage. Hence, this later volume may perhaps rightly claim to present
      &mdash;and in part to be, though necessarily imperfect&mdash;the sole and
      a true &ldquo;Log of the MAY-FLOWER.&rdquo; No effort has been made, however, to
      reduce the collated data to the shape and style of the ship&rsquo;s &ldquo;Log&rdquo; of
      recent times, whose matter and form are largely prescribed by maritime
      law. While it is not possible to give, as the original&mdash;if it existed&mdash;would
      have done, the results of the navigators&rsquo; observations day by day; the
      &ldquo;Lat.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Long.&rdquo;; the variations of the wind and of the magnetic needle;
      the tallies of the &ldquo;lead&rdquo; and &ldquo;log&rdquo; lines; &ldquo;the daily run,&rdquo; etc.&mdash;in
      all else the record may confidently be assumed to vary little from that
      presumably kept, in some form, by Captain Jones, the competent Master of
      the Pilgrim bark, and his mates, Masters Clarke and Coppin.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the charter was for the &ldquo;round voyage,&rdquo; all the features and incidents
      of that voyage until complete, whether at sea or in port, properly find
      entry in its journal, and are therefore included in this compilation,
      which it is hoped may hence prove of reference value to such as take
      interest in Pilgrim studies. Although the least pleasant to the author,
      not the least valuable feature of the work to the reader&mdash;especially
      if student or writer of Pilgrim history&mdash;will be found, it is
      believed, in the numerous corrections of previously published errors which
      it contains, some of which are radical and of much historical importance.
      It is true that new facts and items of information which have been coming
      to light, in long neglected or newly discovered documents, etc., are
      correctives of earlier and natural misconceptions, and a certain
      percentage of error is inevitable, but many radical and reckless errors
      have been made in Pilgrim history which due study and care must have
      prevented. Such errors have so great and rapidly extending power for harm,
      and, when built upon, so certainly bring the superstructure tumbling to
      the ground, that the competent and careful workman can render no better
      service than to point out and correct them wherever found, undeterred by
      the association of great names, or the consciousness of his own liability
      to blunder. A sound and conscientious writer will welcome the courteous
      correction of his error, in the interest of historical accuracy; the
      opinion of any other need not be regarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the new contributions (or original demonstrations), of more or
      less historical importance, made to the history of the Pilgrims, as the
      author believes, by this volume, are as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) A closely approximate list of the passengers who left Delfshaven on
      the SPEEDWELL for Southampton; in other words, the names&mdash;those of
      Carver and Cushman and of the latter&rsquo;s family being added&mdash;of the
      Leyden contingent of the MAY-FLOWER Pilgrims.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) A closely approximate list of the passengers who left London in the
      MAY-FLOWER for Southampton; in other words, the names (with the deduction
      of Cushman and family, of Carver, who was at Southampton, and of an
      unknown few who abandoned the voyage at Plymouth) of the English
      contingent of the MAY-FLOWER Pilgrims.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) The establishment as correct, beyond reasonable doubt, of the date,
      Sunday, June 11/21, 1620, affixed by Robert Cushman to his letter to the
      Leyden leaders (announcing the &ldquo;turning of the tide&rdquo; in Pilgrim affairs,
      the hiring of the &ldquo;pilott&rdquo; Clarke, etc.), contrary to the conclusions of
      Prince, Arber, and others, that the letter could not have been written on
      Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) The demonstration of the fact that on Saturday, June 10/20, 1620,
      Cushman&rsquo;s efforts alone apparently turned the tide in Pilgrim affairs;
      brought Weston to renewed and decisive cooperation; secured the employment
      of a &ldquo;pilot,&rdquo; and definite action toward hiring a ship, marking it as one
      of the most notable and important of Pilgrim &ldquo;red-letter days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (e) The demonstration of the fact that the ship of which Weston and
      Cushman took &ldquo;the refusal,&rdquo; on Saturday, June 10/20, 1620, was not the
      MAY-FLOWER, as Young, Deane, Goodwin, and other historians allege.
    </p>
    <p>
      (f) The demonstration of the fact (overthrowing the author&rsquo;s own earlier
      views) that the estimates and criticisms of Robinson, Carver, Brown,
      Goodwin, and others upon Robert Cushman were unwarranted, unjust, and
      cruel, and that he was, in fact, second to none in efficient service to
      the Pilgrims; and hence so ranks in title to grateful appreciation and
      memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      (g) The demonstration of the fact that the MAY-FLOWER was not chartered
      later than June 19/29, 1620, and was probably chartered in the week of
      June 12/22&mdash;June 19/29 of that year.
    </p>
    <p>
      (h) The addition of several new names to the list of the Merchant
      Adventurers, hitherto unpublished as such, with considerable new data
      concerning the list in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      (i) The demonstration of the fact that Martin and Mullens, of the
      MAY-FLOWER colonists, were also Merchant Adventurers, while William White
      was probably such.
    </p>
    <p>
      (j) The demonstration of the fact that &ldquo;Master Williamson,&rdquo; the
      much-mooted incognito of Bradford&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mourt&rsquo;s Relation&rdquo; (whose existence
      even has often been denied by Pilgrim writers), was none other than the
      &ldquo;ship&rsquo;s-merchant,&rdquo; or &ldquo;purser&rdquo; of the MAY-FLOWER,&mdash;hitherto unknown
      as one of her officers, and historically wholly unidentified.
    </p>
    <p>
      (k) The general description of; and many particulars concerning, the
      MAY-FLOWER herself; her accommodations (especially as to her cabins), her
      crew, etc., hitherto unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) The demonstration of the fact that the witnesses to the nuncupative
      will of William Mullens were two of the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S crew (one being
      possibly the ship&rsquo;s surgeon), thus furnishing the names of two more of the
      ship&rsquo;s company, and the only names&mdash;except those of her chief
      officers&mdash;ever ascertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      (m) The indication of the strong probability that the entire company of
      the Merchant Adventurers signed, on the one part, the charter-party of the
      MAY-FLOWER.
    </p>
    <p>
      (n) An (approximate) list of the ages of the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S passengers and
      the respective occupations of the adults.
    </p>
    <p>
      (o) The demonstration of the fact that no less than five of the Merchant
      Adventurers cast in their lots and lives with the Plymouth Pilgrims as
      colonists.
    </p>
    <p>
      (p) The indication of the strong probability that Thomas Goffe, Esquire,
      one of the Merchant Adventurers, owned the &ldquo;MAY-FLOWER&rdquo; when she was
      chartered for the Pilgrim voyage,&mdash;as also on her voyages to New
      England in 1629 and 1630.
    </p>
    <p>
      (q) The demonstration of the fact that the Master of the MAY-FLOWER was
      Thomas Jones, and that there was an intrigue with Master Jones to land the
      Pilgrims at some point north of the 41st parallel of north latitude, the
      other parties to which were, not the Dutch, as heretofore claimed, but
      none other than Sir Ferdinando Gorges and the Earl of Warwick, chiefs of
      the &ldquo;Council for New England,&rdquo; in furtherance of a successful scheme of
      Gorges to steal the Pilgrim colony from the London Virginia Company, for
      the more &ldquo;northern Plantations&rdquo; of the conspirators.
    </p>
    <p>
      (r) The demonstration of the fact that a second attempt at stealing the
      colony&mdash;by which John Pierce, one of the Adventurers, endeavored to
      possess himself of the demesne and rights of the colonists, and to make
      them his tenants&mdash;was defeated only by the intervention of the
      &ldquo;Council&rdquo; and the Crown, the matter being finally settled by compromise
      and the transfer of the patent by Pierce (hitherto questioned) to the
      colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      (s) The demonstration of the actual relations of the Merchant Adventurers
      and the Pilgrim colonists&mdash;their respective bodies being associated
      as but two partners in an equal copartnership, the interests of the
      respective partners being (probably) held upon differing bases&mdash;contrary
      to the commonly published and accepted view.
    </p>
    <p>
      (t) The demonstration of the fact that the MAY-FLOWER&mdash;contrary to
      the popular impression&mdash;did not enter Plymouth harbor, as a &ldquo;lone
      vessel,&rdquo; slowly &ldquo;feeling her way&rdquo; by chart and lead-line, but was
      undoubtedly piloted to her anchorage&mdash;previously &ldquo;sounded&rdquo; for her&mdash;by
      the Pilgrim shallop, which doubtless accompanied her from Cape Cod harbor,
      on both her efforts to make this haven, under her own sails.
    </p>
    <p>
      (u) The indication of the strong probability that Thomas English was
      helmsman of the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S shallop (and so savior of her sovereign
      company, at the entrance of Plymouth harbor on the stormy night of the
      landing on Clarke&rsquo;s Island), and that hence to him the salvation of the
      Pilgrim colony is probably due; and
    </p>
    <p>
      (v) Many facts not hitherto published, or generally known, as to the
      antecedents, relationships, etc., of individual Pilgrims of both the
      Leyden and the English contingents, and of certain of the Merchant
      Adventurers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For convenience&rsquo; sake, both the Old Style and the New Style dates of many
      events are annexed to their mention, and double-dating is followed
      throughout the narrative journal or &ldquo;Log&rdquo; of the Pilgrim ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Gregorian and other corrections of the calendar are now generally
      well understood, and have been so often stated in detail in print, it is
      thought sufficient to note here their concrete results as affecting dates
      occurring in Pilgrim and later literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 1582 to 1700 the difference between O.S. and N.S. was ten (10) days
      (the leap-year being passed in 1600). From 1700 to 1800 it was eleven (11)
      days, because 1700 in O.S. was leap-year. From 1800 to 1900 the difference
      is twelve (12) days, and from 1900 to 2000 it will be thirteen (13) days.
      All the Dutch dates were New Style, while English dates were yet of the
      Old Style.

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE NAME&mdash;&ldquo;MAY-FLOWER&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curiously enough,&rdquo; observes Professor Arber, &ldquo;these names [MAY-FLOWER and
      SPEEDWELL] do not occur either in the Bradford manuscript or in &lsquo;Mourt&rsquo;s
      Relation.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [A Relation, or Journal, of the Beginning and Proceedings of the
     English Plantation settled at Plymouth in New England, etc.  G.
     Mourt, London, 1622.  Undoubtedly the joint product of Bradford and
     Winslow, and sent to George Morton at London for publication.
     Bradford says (op, cit. p. 120): &ldquo;Many other smaler maters I omite,
     sundrie of them having been already published, in a Jurnall made by
     one of ye company,&rdquo; etc.  From this it would appear that Mourt&rsquo;s
     Relation was his work, which it doubtless principally was, though
     Winslow performed an honorable part, as &ldquo;Mourt&rsquo;s&rdquo; introduction and
     other data prove.]
</pre>
    <p>
      He might have truthfully added that they nowhere appear in any of the
      letters of the &ldquo;exodus&rdquo; period, whether from Carver, Robinson, Cushman, or
      Weston; or in the later publications of Window; or in fact of any
      contemporaneous writer. It is not strange, therefore, that the Rev. Mr.
      Blaxland, the able author of the &ldquo;Mayflower Essays,&rdquo; should have asked for
      the authority for the names assigned to the two Pilgrim ships of 1620.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems to be the fact, as noted by Arber, that the earliest authentic
      evidence that the bark which bore the Pilgrims across the North Atlantic
      in the late autumn of 1620 was the MAY-FLOWER, is the &ldquo;heading&rdquo; of the
      &ldquo;Allotment of Lands&rdquo;&mdash;happily an &ldquo;official&rdquo; document&mdash;made at
      New Plymouth, New England, in March, 1623&mdash;It is not a little
      remarkable that, with the constantly recurring references to &ldquo;the ship,&rdquo;&mdash;the
      all-important factor in Pilgrim history,&mdash;her name should nowhere
      have found mention in the earliest Pilgrim literature. Bradford uses the
      terms, the &ldquo;biger ship,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;larger ship,&rdquo; and Winslow, Cushman,
      Captain John Smith, and others mention simply the &ldquo;vessel,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;ship,&rdquo;
       when speaking of the MAY-FLOWER, but in no case give her a name.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is somewhat startling to find so thorough-paced an Englishman as Thomas
      Carlyle calling her the MAY-FLOWER &ldquo;of Delft-Haven,&rdquo; as in the quotation
      from him on a preceding page. That he knew better cannot be doubted, and
      it must be accounted one of those &lsquo;lapsus calami&rsquo; readily forgiven to
      genius,&mdash;proverbially indifferent to detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Ferdinando Gorges makes the curious misstatement that the Pilgrims had
      three ships, and says of them: &ldquo;Of the three ships (such as their weak
      fortunes were able to provide), whereof two proved unserviceable and so
      were left behind, the third with great difficulty reached the coast of New
      England,&rdquo; etc.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S CONSORT THE SPEEDWELL
    </h3>
    <p>
      The SPEEDWELL was the first vessel procured by the Leyden Pilgrims for the
      emigration, and was bought by themselves; as she was the ship of their
      historic embarkation at Delfshaven, and that which carried the originators
      of the enterprise to Southampton, to join the MAY-FLOWER, &mdash;whose
      consort she was to be; and as she became a determining factor in the
      latter&rsquo;s belated departure for New England, she may justly claim mention
      here as indeed an inseparable &ldquo;part and parcel&rdquo; of the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S
      voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of this vessel of associate historic renown with the MAY-FLOWER
      was even longer in finding record in the early literature of the Pilgrim
      hegira than that of the larger It first appeared, so far as discovered, in
      1669&mdash;nearly fifty years after her memorable service to the Pilgrims
      on the fifth page of Nathaniel Morton&rsquo;s &ldquo;New England&rsquo;s Memorial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Davis, in his &ldquo;Ancient Landmarks of Plymouth,&rdquo; makes a singular error for
      so competent a writer, when he says: &ldquo;The agents of the company in England
      had hired the SPEEDWELL, of sixty tons, and sent her to Delfthaven, to
      convey the colonists to Southampton.&rdquo; In this, however, he but follows
      Mather and the &ldquo;Modern Universal History,&rdquo; though both are notably
      unreliable; but he lacks their excuse, for they were without his access to
      Bradford&rsquo;s &ldquo;Historie.&rdquo; That the consort-pinnace was neither &ldquo;hired&rdquo; nor
      &ldquo;sent to Delfthaven&rdquo; duly appears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradford states the fact,&mdash;that &ldquo;a smale ship (of some 60 tune), was
      bought and fitted in Holand, which was intended to serve to help to
      transport them, so to stay in ye countrie and atend ye fishing and such
      other affairs as might be for ye good and benefite of ye colonie when they
      come ther.&rdquo; The statements of Bradford and others indicate that she was
      bought and refitted with moneys raised in Holland, but it is not easy to
      understand the transaction, in view of the understood terms of the
      business compact between the Adventurers and the Planters, as hereinafter
      outlined. The Merchant Adventurers&mdash;who were organized (but not
      incorporated) chiefly through the activity of Thomas Weston, a merchant of
      London, to &ldquo;finance&rdquo; the Pilgrim undertaking&mdash;were bound, as part of
      their engagement, to provide the necessary shipping,&rsquo; etc., for the
      voyage. The &ldquo;joint-stock or partnership,&rdquo; as it was called in the
      agreement of the Adventurers and Planters, was an equal partnership
      between but two parties, the Adventurers, as a body, being one of the
      co-partners; the Planter colonists, as a body, the other. It was a
      partnership to run for seven years, to whose capital stock the first-named
      partner (the Adventurers) was bound to contribute whatever moneys, or
      their equivalents,&mdash;some subscriptions were paid in goods, &mdash;were
      necessary to transport, equip, and maintain the colony and provide it the
      means of traffic, etc., for the term named. The second-named partner (the
      Planter body) was to furnish the men, women, and children, &mdash;the
      colonists themselves, and their best endeavors, essential to the
      enterprise,&mdash;and such further contributions of money or provisions,
      on an agreed basis, as might be practicable for them. At the expiration of
      the seven years, all properties of every kind were to be divided into two
      equal parts, of which the Adventurers were to take one and the Planters
      the other, in full satisfaction of their respective investments and
      claims. The Adventurers&rsquo; half would of course be divided among themselves,
      in such proportion as their individual contributions bore to the sum total
      invested. The Planters would divide their half among their number,
      according to their respective contributions of persons, money, or
      provisions, as per the agreed basis, which was:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Bradford&rsquo;s Historie, Deane&rsquo;s ed.; Arber, op. cit.  p. 305.
     The fact that Lyford (Bradford, Historie, Mass. ed. p. 217)
     recommended that every &ldquo;particular&rdquo; (i.e.  non-partnership colonist)
     sent out by the Adventurers&mdash;and they had come to be mostly of that
     class&mdash;&ldquo;should come over as an Adventurer, even if only a servant,&rdquo;
      and the fact that he recognized that some one would have to pay in
     L10 to make each one an Adventurer, would seem to indicate that any
     one was eligible and that either L10 was the price of the Merchant
     Adventurer&rsquo;s share, or that this was the smallest subscription which
     would admit to membership.  Such &ldquo;particular,&rdquo; even although an
     Adventurer, had no partnership share in the Planters&rsquo; half-interest;
     had no voice in the government, and no claim for maintenance.  He
     was, however, amenable to the government, subject to military duty
     and to tax.  The advantage of being an Adventurer without a voice in
     colony affairs would be purely a moral one.]
</pre>
    <p>
      <br /> that every person joining the enterprise, whether man, woman, youth,
      maid, or servant, if sixteen years old, should count as a share; that a
      share should be reckoned at L10, and hence that L10 worth of money or
      provisions should also count as a share. Every man, therefore, would be
      entitled to one share for each person (if sixteen years of age) he
      contributed, and for each L10 of money or provisions he added thereto,
      another share. Two children between ten and sixteen would count as one and
      be allowed a share in the division, but children under ten were to have
      only fifty acres of wild land. The scheme was admirable for its equity,
      simplicity, and elasticity, and was equally so for either capitalist or
      colonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goodwin notes, that, &ldquo;in an edition of Cushman&rsquo;s &lsquo;Discourse,&rsquo; Judge Davis
      of Boston advanced the idea that at first the Pilgrims put all their
      possessions into a common stock, and until 1623 had no individual
      property. In his edition of Morton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Memorial&rsquo; he honorably admits his
      error.&rdquo; The same mistake was made by Robertson and Chief Justice Marshall,
      and is occasionally repeated in this day. &ldquo;There was no community of
      goods, though there was labor in common, with public supplies of food and
      clothing.&rdquo; Neither is there warrant for the conclusion of Goodwin, that
      because the holdings of the Planters&rsquo; half interest in the undertaking
      were divided into L10 shares, those of the Adventurers were also. It is
      not impossible, but it does not necessarily follow, and certain known
      facts indicate the contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rev. Edward Everett Hale, in &ldquo;The Pilgrims&rsquo; Life in Common,&rdquo; says:
      &ldquo;Carver, Winslow, Bradford, Brewster, Standish, Fuller, and Allerton. were
      the persons of largest means in the Leyden group of the emigrants. It
      seems as if their quota of subscription to the common stock were paid in
      &lsquo;provisions&rsquo; for the voyage and the colony, and that by &lsquo;provisions&rsquo; is
      meant such articles of food as could be best bought in Holland.&rdquo; The good
      Doctor is clearly in error, in the above. Allerton was probably as &ldquo;well
      off&rdquo; as any of the Leyden contingent, while Francis Cooke and Degory
      Priest were probably &ldquo;better off&rdquo; than either Brewster or Standish, who
      apparently had little of this world&rsquo;s goods. Neither is there any evidence
      that any considerable amount of &ldquo;provision&rdquo; was bought in Holland. Quite a
      large sum of money, which came, apparently, from the pockets of the Leyden
      Adventurers (Pickering, Greene, etc.), and some of the Pilgrims, was
      requisite to pay for the SPEEDWELL and her refitting, etc.; but how much
      came from either is conjectural at best. But aside from &ldquo;Hollands cheese,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;strong-waters&rdquo; (schnapps), some few things that Cushman names; and
      probably a few others, obtained in Holland, most of the &ldquo;provisioning,&rdquo; as
      repeatedly appears, was done at the English Southampton. In fact, after
      clothing and generally &ldquo;outfitting&rdquo; themselves, it is pretty certain that
      but few of the Leyden party had much left. There was evidently an
      understanding between the partners that there should be four principal
      agents charged with the preparations for, and carrying out of, the
      enterprise,&mdash;Thomas Weston and Christopher Martin representing the
      Adventurers and the colonists who were recruited in England (Martin being
      made treasurer), while Carver and Cushman acted for the Leyden company.
      John Pierce seems to have been the especial representative of the
      Adventurers in the matter of the obtaining of the Patent from the (London)
      Virginia Company, and later from the Council for New England. Bradford
      says: &ldquo;For besides these two formerly mentioned, sent from Leyden, viz.,
      Master Carver and Robert Cushman, there was one chosen in England to be
      joyned with them, to make the provisions for the Voyage. His name was
      Master Martin. He came from Billerike in Essexe; from which parts came
      sundry others to go with them; as also from London and other places, and
      therefore it was thought meet and convenient by them in Holand, that these
      strangers that were to goe with them, should appointe one thus to be
      joyned with them; not so much from any great need of their help as to
      avoid all susspition, or jealosie, of any partialitie.&rdquo; But neither
      Weston, Martin, Carver, nor Cushman seems to have been directly concerned
      in the purchase of the SPEEDWELL. The most probable conjecture concerning
      it is, that in furtherance of the purpose of the Leyden leaders, stated by
      Bradford, that there should be a small vessel for their service in
      fishing, traffic, etc., wherever they might plant the colony, they were
      permitted by the Adventurers to purchase the SPEEDWELL for that service,
      and as a consort, &ldquo;on general account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is evident, however, from John Robinson&rsquo;s letter of June 14, 1620, to
      John Carver, that Weston ridiculed the transaction, probably on selfish
      grounds, but, as events proved, not without some justification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robinson says: &ldquo;Master Weston makes himself merry with our endeavors about
      buying a ship,&rdquo; [the SPEEDWELL] &ldquo;but we have done nothing in this but with
      good reason, as I am persuaded.&rdquo; Although bought with funds raised in
      Holland,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Arber (The Story of the Pilgrim Fathers, p. 341) arrives at the
     conclusion that &ldquo;The SPEEDWELL had been bought with Leyden money.
     The proceeds of her sale, after her return to London, would, of
     course, go to the credit of the common joint-Stock there.&rdquo;  This
     inference seems warranted by Robinson&rsquo;s letter of June 16/26 to
     Carver, in which he clearly indicates that the Leyden brethren
     collected the &ldquo;Adventurers&rdquo; subscriptions of Pickering and his
     partner (Greene), which were evidently considerable.]
</pre>
    <p>
      <br /> it was evidently upon &ldquo;joint-account,&rdquo; and she was doubtless so
      sold, as alleged, on her arrival in September, at London, having proved
      unseaworthy. In fact, the only view of this transaction that harmonizes
      with the known facts and the respective rights and relations of the
      parties is, that permission was obtained (perhaps through Edward
      Pickering, one of the Adventurers, a merchant of Leyden, and others) that
      the Leyden leaders should buy and refit the consort, and in so doing might
      expend the funds which certain of the Leyden Pilgrims were to pay into the
      enterprise, which it appears they did,&mdash;and for which they would
      receive, as shown, extra shares in the Planters&rsquo; half-interest. It was
      very possibly further permitted by the Adventurers, that Mr. Pickering&rsquo;s
      and his partners&rsquo; subscriptions to their capital stock should be applied
      to the purchase of the SPEEDWELL, as they were collected by the Leyden
      leaders, as Pastor Robinson&rsquo;s letter of June 14/24 to John Carver,
      previously noted, clearly shows.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was obviously bought some little time before May 31, 1620,&mdash;probably
      in the early part of the month,&mdash;from the fact that in their letter
      of May 31st to Carver and Cushman, then in London, Messrs. Fuller,
      Winslow, Bradford, and Allerton state that &ldquo;we received divers letters at
      the coming of Master Nash and our Pilott,&rdquo; etc. From this it is clear that
      time enough had elapsed, since their purchase of the pinnace, for their
      messenger (Master Nash) to go to London,&mdash;evidently with a request to
      Carver and Cushman that they would send over a competent &ldquo;pilott&rdquo; to refit
      her, and for Nash to return with him, while the letter announcing their
      arrival does not seem to have been immediately written.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writers of the above-mentioned letter use the words &ldquo;we received,&rdquo;
       &mdash;using the past tense, as if some days before, instead of &ldquo;we have
      your letters,&rdquo; or &ldquo;we have just received your letters,&rdquo; which would rather
      indicate present, or recent, time. Probably some days elapsed after the
      &ldquo;pilott&rsquo;s&rdquo; arrival, before this letter of acknowledgment was sent. It is
      hence fair to assume that the pinnace was bought early in May, and that no
      time was lost by the Leyden party in preparing for the exodus, after their
      negotiations with the Dutch were &ldquo;broken off&rdquo; and they had &ldquo;struck hands&rdquo;
       with Weston, sometime between February 2/12, 1619/20, and April 1/11,
      1620,&mdash;probably in March.

      The consort was a pinnace&mdash;as vessels of her class were then and for
      many years called&mdash;of sixty tons burden, as already stated, having
      two masts, which were put in&mdash;as we are informed by Bradford, and are
      not allowed by Professor Arber to forget&mdash;as apart of her refitting
      in Holland. That she was &ldquo;square-rigged,&rdquo; and generally of the then
      prevalent style of vessels of her size and class, is altogether probable.
      The name pinnace was applied to vessels having a wide range in tonnage,
      etc., from a craft of hardly more than ten or fifteen tons to one of sixty
      or eighty. It was a term of pretty loose and indefinite adaptation and
      covered most of the smaller craft above a shallop or ketch, from such as
      could be propelled by oars, and were so fitted, to a small ship of the
      SPEEDWELL&rsquo;S class, carrying an armament.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of the many representations of the SPEEDWELL which appear in
      historical pictures are authentic, though some doubtless give correct
      ideas of her type. Weir&rsquo;s painting of the &ldquo;Embarkation of the Pilgrims,&rdquo;
       in the Capitol at Washington (and Parker&rsquo;s copy of the same in Pilgrim
      Hall, Plymouth); Lucy&rsquo;s painting of the &ldquo;Departure of the Pilgrims,&rdquo; in
      Pilgrim Hall; Copes great painting in the corridor of the British Houses
      of Parliament, and others of lesser note, all depict the vessel on much
      the same lines, but nothing can be claimed for any of them, except
      fidelity to a type of vessel of that day and class. Perhaps the best
      illustration now known of a craft of this type is given in the painting by
      the Cuyps, father and son, of the &ldquo;Departure of the Pilgrims from
      Delfshaven,&rdquo; as reproduced by Dr. W. E. Griffis, as the frontispiece to
      his little monograph, &ldquo;The Pilgrims in their Three Homes.&rdquo; No reliable
      description of the pinnace herself is known to exist, and but few facts
      concerning her have been gleaned. That she was fairly &ldquo;roomy&rdquo; for a small
      number of passengers, and had decent accommodations, is inferable from the
      fact that so many as thirty were assigned to her at Southampton, for the
      Atlantic voyage (while the MAY-FLOWER, three times her tonnage, but of
      greater proportionate capacity, had but ninety), as also from the fact
      that &ldquo;the chief [i.e. principal people] of them that came from Leyden went
      in this ship, to give Master Reynolds content.&rdquo; That she mounted at least
      &ldquo;three pieces of ordnance&rdquo; appears by the testimony of Edward Winslow, and
      they probably comprised her armament.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen that Bradford notes the purchase and refitting of this &ldquo;smale
      ship of 60 tune&rdquo; in Holland. The story of her several sailings, her
      &ldquo;leakiness,&rdquo; her final return, and her abandonment as unseaworthy, is
      familiar. We find, too, that Bradford also states in his &ldquo;Historie,&rdquo; that
      &ldquo;the leakiness of this ship was partly by her being overmasted and too
      much pressed with sails.&rdquo; It will, however, amaze the readers of Professor
      Arber&rsquo;s generally excellent &ldquo;Story of the Pilgrim Fathers,&rdquo; so often
      referred to herein, to find him sharply arraigning &ldquo;those members of the
      Leyden church who were responsible for the fitting of the SPEEDWELL,&rdquo;
       alleging that &ldquo;they were the proximate causes of most of the troubles on
      the voyage [of the MAY-FLOWER] out; and of many of the deaths at Plymouth
      in New England in the course of the following Spring; for they overmasted
      the vessel, and by so doing strained her hull while sailing.&rdquo; To this
      straining, Arber wholly ascribes the &ldquo;leakiness&rdquo; of the SPEEDWELL and the
      delay in the final departure of the MAYFLOWER, to which last he attributes
      the disastrous results he specifies. It would seem that the historian,
      unduly elated at what he thought the discovery of another &ldquo;turning-point
      of modern history,&rdquo; endeavors to establish it by such assertions and such
      partial references to Bradford as would support the imaginary &ldquo;find.&rdquo;
       Briefly stated, this alleged discovery, which he so zealously announces,
      is that if the SPEEDWELL had not been overmasted, both she and the
      MAY-FLOWER would have arrived early in the fall at the mouth of the Hudson
      River, and the whole course of New England history would have been
      entirely different. Ergo, the &ldquo;overmasting&rdquo; of the SPEEDWELL was a
      &ldquo;pivotal point in modern history.&rdquo; With the idea apparently of giving
      eclat to this announcement and of attracting attention to it, he
      surprisingly charges the responsibility for the &ldquo;overmasting&rdquo; and its
      alleged dire results upon the leaders of the Leyden church, &ldquo;who were,&rdquo; he
      repeatedly asserts, &ldquo;alone responsible.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, however,
      Bradford expressly states (in the same paragraph as that upon which
      Professor Arber must wholly base his sweeping assertions) that the
      &ldquo;overmasting&rdquo; was but &ldquo;partly&rdquo; responsible for the SPEEDWELL&rsquo;S leakiness,
      and directly shows that the &ldquo;stratagem&rdquo; of her master and crew,
      &ldquo;afterwards,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;known, and by some confessed,&rdquo; was the chief cause
      of her leakiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cushman also shows, by his letter,&mdash;written after the ships had put
      back into Dartmouth,&mdash;a part of which Professor Arber uses, but the
      most important part suppresses, that what he evidently considers the
      principal leak was caused by a very &ldquo;loose board&rdquo; (plank), which was
      clearly not the result of the straining due to &ldquo;crowding sail,&rdquo; or of
      &ldquo;overmasting.&rdquo; (See Appendix.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, as the Leyden chiefs were careful to employ a presumably
      competent man (&ldquo;pilott,&rdquo; afterwards &ldquo;Master&rdquo; Reynolds) to take charge of
      refitting the consort, they were hence clearly, both legally and morally,
      exempt from responsibility as to any alterations made. Even though the
      &ldquo;overmasting&rdquo; had been the sole cause of the SPEEDWELL&rsquo;S leakiness, and
      the delays and vicissitudes which resulted to the MAY-FLOWER and her
      company, the leaders of the Leyden church&mdash;whom Professor Arber
      arraigns &mdash;(themselves chiefly the sufferers) were in no wise at
      fault! It is clear, however, that the &ldquo;overmasting&rdquo; cut but small figure
      in the case; &ldquo;confessed&rdquo; rascality in making a leak otherwise, being the
      chief trouble, and this, as well as the &ldquo;overmasting,&rdquo; lay at the door of
      Master Reynolds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if the MAY-FLOWER had not been delayed by the SPEEDWELL&rsquo;S condition,
      and both had sailed for &ldquo;Hudson&rsquo;s River&rdquo; in midsummer, it is by no means
      certain that they would have reached there, as Arber so confidently
      asserts. The treachery of Captain Jones, in league with Gorges, would as
      readily have landed them, by some pretext, on Cape Cod in October, as in
      December. But even though they had landed at the mouth of the Hudson,
      there is no good reason why the Pilgrim influence should not have worked
      north and east, as well as it did west and south, and with the
      Massachusetts Bay Puritans there, Roger Williams in Rhode Island, and the
      younger Winthrop in Connecticut, would doubtless have made New England
      history very much what it has been, and not, as Professor Arber asserts,
      &ldquo;entirely different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cruel indictment fails, and the imaginary &ldquo;turning point in modern
      history,&rdquo; to announce which Professor Arber seems to have sacrificed so
      much, falls with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Dr. Griffis (&ldquo;The Pilgrims in their Three Homes,&rdquo; p. 158) seems
      to give ear to Professor Arber&rsquo;s untenable allegations as to the Pilgrim
      leaders&rsquo; responsibility for any error made in the &ldquo;overmasting&rdquo; of the
      SPEEDWELL, although he destroys his case by saying of the &ldquo;overmasting:&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Whether it was done in England or Holland is not certain.&rdquo; He says,
      unhappily chiming in with Arber&rsquo;s indictment: &ldquo;In their eagerness to get
      away promptly, they [the Leyden men] made the mistake of ordering for the
      SPEEDWELL heavier and taller masts and larger spars than her hull had been
      built to receive, thus altering most unwisely and disastrously her trim.&rdquo;
       He adds still more unhappily: &ldquo;We do not hear of these inveterate landsmen
      and townsfolk [of whom he says, &lsquo;possibly there was not one man familiar
      with ships or sea life&rsquo;] who were about to venture on the Atlantic, taking
      counsel of Dutch builders or mariners as to the proportion of their
      craft.&rdquo; Why so discredit the capacity and intelligence of these
      nation-builders? Was their sagacity ever found unequal to the problems
      they met? Were the men who commanded confidence and respect in every
      avenue of affairs they entered; who talked with kings and dealt with
      statesmen; these diplomats, merchants, students, artisans, and
      manufacturers; these men who learned law, politics, state craft, town
      building, navigation, husbandry, boat-building, and medicine, likely to
      deal negligently or presumptuously with matters upon which they were not
      informed? Their first act, after buying the SPEEDWELL, was to send to
      England for an &ldquo;expert&rdquo; to take charge of all technical matters of her
      &ldquo;outfitting,&rdquo; which was done, beyond all question, in Holland. What need
      had they, having done this (very probably upon the advice of those
      experienced ship-merchants, their own &ldquo;Adventurers&rdquo; and townsmen, Edward
      Pickering and William Greene), to consult Dutch ship-builders or mariners?
      She was to be an English ship, under the English flag, with English
      owners, and an English captain; why: should they defer to Dutch seamen or
      put other than an English &ldquo;expert&rdquo; in charge of her alterations,
      especially when England rightfully boasted the best? But not only were
      these Leyden leaders not guilty of any laches as indicted by Arber and too
      readily convicted by Griffis, but the &ldquo;overmasting&rdquo; was of small account
      as compared with the deliberate rascality of captain and crew, in the
      disabling of the consort, as expressly certified by Bradford, who
      certainly, as an eye-witness, knew whereof he affirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having bought a vessel, it was necessary to fit her for the severe service
      in which she was to be employed; to provision her for the voyage, etc.;
      and this could be done properly only by experienced hands. The Pilgrim
      leaders at Leyden seem, therefore, as noted, to have sent to their agents
      at London for a competent man to take charge of this work, and were sent a
      &ldquo;pilott&rdquo; (or &ldquo;mate&rdquo;), doubtless presumed to be equal to the task. Goodwin
      mistakenly says: &ldquo;As Spring waned, Thomas Nash went from Leyden to confer
      with the agents at London. He soon returned with a pilot (doubtless [sic]
      Robert Coppin), who was to conduct the Continental party to England.&rdquo; This
      is both wild and remarkable &ldquo;guessing&rdquo; for the usually careful compiler of
      the &ldquo;Pilgrim Republic.&rdquo; There is no warrant whatever for this assumption,
      and everything contra-indicates it, although two such excellent
      authorities as Dr. Dexter and Goodwin coincide&mdash;the latter
      undoubtedly copying the former&mdash;concerning Coppin; both being
      doubtless in error, as hereafter shown. Dexter says &ldquo;My impression is that
      Coppin was originally hired to go in the SPEEDWELL, and that he was the
      &lsquo;pilott&rsquo; whose coming was &lsquo;a great incouragement&rsquo; to the Leyden
      expectants, in the last of May, or first of June, 1620 [before May 31, as
      shown]; that he sailed with them in the SPEEDWELL, but on her final
      putting back was transferred to the MAY-FLOWER.&rdquo; All the direct light any
      one has upon the matter comes from the letter of the Leyden brethren of
      May 31 [O.S.], 1620, previously cited, to Carver and Cushman, and the
      reply of the latter thereto, of Sunday, June 11, 1620. The former as
      noted, say: &ldquo;We received diverse letters at the coming of Master Nash
      [probably Thomas] and our pilott, which is a great incouragement unto us .
      . . and indeed had you not sente him [the &lsquo;pilott,&rsquo; presumably] many would
      have been ready to fainte and goe backe.&rdquo; Neither here nor in any other
      relation is there the faintest suggestion of Coppin, except as what he
      was, &ldquo;the second mate,&rdquo; or &ldquo;pilott,&rdquo; of the MAY-FLOWER. It is not
      reasonable to suppose that, for so small a craft but just purchased, and
      with the expedition yet uncertain, the Leyden leaders or their London
      agents had by June 11, employed both a &ldquo;Master&rdquo; and a &ldquo;pilott&rdquo; for the
      SPEEDWELL, as must have been the case if this &ldquo;pilott&rdquo; was, as Goodwin so
      confidently assumes, &ldquo;doubtless Robert Coppin.&rdquo; For in Robert Cushman&rsquo;s
      letter of Sunday, June 11, as if proposing (now that the larger vessel
      would be at once obtained, and would, as he thought, be &ldquo;ready in fourteen
      days&rdquo;) that the &ldquo;pilott&rdquo; sent over to &ldquo;refit&rdquo; the SPEEDWELL should be
      further utilized, he says: &ldquo;Let Master Reynolds tarrie there
      [inferentially, not return here when his work is done, as we originally
      arranged] and bring the ship [the SPEEDWELL], to Southampton.&rdquo; The latter
      service we know he performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The side lights upon the matter show, beyond doubt:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) That a &ldquo;pilott&rdquo; had been sent to Holland, with Master Nash, before May
      31, 1620;
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) That unless two had been sent (of which there is no suggestion, and
      which is entirely improbable, for obvious reasons), Master Reynolds was
      the &ldquo;pilott&rdquo; who was thus sent;
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) That it is clear, from Cushman&rsquo;s letter of June 11/21, that Reynolds
      was then in Holland, for Cushman directs that &ldquo;Master Reynolds tarrie
      there and bring the ship to Southampton;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (d) That Master Reynolds was not originally intended to &ldquo;tarrie there,&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;bring the ship,&rdquo; etc., as, if he had been, there would have been no
      need of giving such an order; and
    </p>
    <p>
      (e) That he had been sent there for some other purpose than to bring the
      SPEEDWELL to Southampton. Duly considering all the facts together, there
      can be no doubt that only one &ldquo;pilott&rdquo; was sent from England; that he was
      expected to return when the work was done for which he went (apparently
      the refitting of the SPEEDWELL); that he was ordered to remain for a new
      duty, and that the man who performed that duty and brought the ship to
      Southampton (who, we know was Master Reynolds) must have been the
      &ldquo;pilott&rdquo;, sent over.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are told too, by Bradford,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Bradford&rsquo;s Historie, as already cited; Arber, The Story of the
     Pilgrim Fathers, p. 341.  John Brown, in his Pilgrim Fathers of New
     England, p. 198, says: &ldquo;She [the SPEEDWELL] was to remain with the
     colony for a year.&rdquo;  Evidently a mistake, arising from the length of
     time for which her crew were shipped.  The pinnace herself was
     intended, as we have seen, for the permanent use of they colonists,
     and was to remain indefinitely.]
</pre>
    <p>
      <br /> that the crew of the SPEEDWELL &ldquo;were hired for a year,&rdquo; and we know,
      in a general way, that most of them went with her to London when she
      abandoned the voyage. This there is ample evidence Coppin did not do,
      going as he did to New England as &ldquo;second mate&rdquo; or &ldquo;pilott&rdquo; of the
      MAY-FLOWER, which there is no reason to doubt he was when she left London.
      Neither is there anywhere any suggestion that there was at Southampton any
      change in the second mate of the larger ship, as there must have been to
      make good the suggestion of Dr. Dexter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the SPEEDWELL lay while being &ldquo;refitted&rdquo; has not been ascertained,
      though presumably at Delfshaven, whence she sailed, though possibly at one
      of the neighboring larger ports, where her new masts and cordage could be
      &ldquo;set up&rdquo; to best advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that Reynolds&mdash;&ldquo;pilott&rdquo; and &ldquo;Master&rdquo; went from London to
      superintend the &ldquo;making-ready&rdquo; for sea. Nothing is known, however, of his
      antecedents, and nothing of his history after he left the service of the
      Pilgrims in disgrace, except that he appears to have come again to New
      England some years later, in command of a vessel, in the service of the
      reckless adventurer Weston (a traitor to the Pilgrims), through whom, it
      is probable, he was originally selected for their service in Holland.
      Bradford and others entitled to judge have given their opinions of this
      cowardly scoundrel (Reynolds) in unmistakable terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      What other officers and crew the pinnace had does not appear, and we know
      nothing certainly of them, except the time for which they shipped; that
      some of them were fellow-conspirators with the Master (self-confessed), in
      the &ldquo;strategem&rdquo; to compel the SPEEDWELL&rsquo;S abandonment of the voyage; and
      that a few were transferred to the MAYFLOWER. From the fact that the
      sailors Trevore and Ely returned from New Plymouth on the FORTUNE in 1621,
      &ldquo;their time having expired,&rdquo; as Bradford notes, it may be fairly assumed
      that they were originally of the SPEEDWELL&rsquo;S crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the fears of the SPEEDWELL&rsquo;S men had been worked upon, and their
      cooperation thus secured by the artful Reynolds, is clearly indicated by
      the statement of Bradford: &ldquo;For they apprehended that the greater ship
      being of force and in which most of the provisions were stored, she would
      retain enough for herself, whatever became of them or the passengers, and
      indeed such speeches had been cast out by some of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of the list of passengers who embarked at Delfshaven, July 22, 1620,
      &ldquo;bound for Southampton on the English coast, and thence for the northern
      parts of Virginia,&rdquo; we fortunately have a pretty accurate knowledge. All
      of the Leyden congregation who were to emigrate, with the exception of
      Robert Cushman and family, and (probably) John Carver, were doubtless
      passengers upon the SPEEDWELL from Delfshaven to Southampton, though the
      presence of Elder Brewster has been questioned. The evidence that he was
      there is well-nigh as conclusive as that Robert Cushman sailed on the
      MAY-FLOWER from London, and that Carver, who had been for some months in
      England,&mdash;chiefly at Southampton, making preparations for the voyage,
      was there to meet the ships on their arrival. It is possible, of course,
      that Cushman&rsquo;s wife and son came on the SPEEDWELL from Delfshaven; but is
      not probable. Among the passengers, however, were some who, like Thomas
      Blossom and his son, William Ring, and others, abandoned the voyage to
      America at Plymouth, and returned in the pinnace to London and thence went
      back to Holland. Deducting from the passenger list of the MAYFLOWER those
      known to have been of the English contingent, with Robert Cushman and
      family, and John Carver, we have a very close approximate to the
      SPEEDWELL&rsquo;S company on her &ldquo;departure from Delfshaven.&rdquo; It has not been
      found possible to determine with absolute certainty the correct relation
      of a few persons. They may have been of the Leyden contingent and so have
      come with their brethren on the SPEEDWELL, or they may have been of the
      English colonists, and first embarked either at London or at Southampton,
      or even at Plymouth,&mdash;though none are supposed to have joined the
      emigrants there or at Dartmouth.
    </p>

      The list of those embarking at Delfshaven on the SPEEDWELL, and so of the
      participants in that historic event,&mdash;a list now published for the

     Deacon Carver coming from Essex in England,&mdash;as they could hardly
     have been in England with Carver during the time of his exacting
     work of preparation.  He, it is quite certain, was not a passenger
     on the Speedwell, for Pastor Robinson would hardly have sent him
     such a letter as that received by him at Southampton, previously
     mentioned (Bradford&rsquo;s &ldquo;Historie,&rdquo; Deane&rsquo;s ed. p. 63), if he had been
     with him at Delfshaven at the &ldquo;departure,&rdquo; a few days before.  Nor
     if he had handed it to him at Delfshaven, would he have told him in
     it, &ldquo;I have written a large letter to the whole company.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Howland was clearly a &ldquo;secretary&rdquo; or &ldquo;steward,&rdquo; rather than a
     &ldquo;servant,&rdquo; and a man of standing and influence from the outset.
     That he was in Leyden and hence a SPEEDWELL passenger appears
     altogether probable, but is not absolutely certain.

Desire Minter (or Minther) was undoubtedly the daughter of Sarah, who,
     the &ldquo;Troth Book&rdquo; (or &ldquo;marriage-in-tention&rdquo; records) for 1616, at the
     Stadtbuis of Leyden, shows, was probably wife or widow of one
     William Minther&mdash;evidently of Pastor Robinson&rsquo;s congregation&mdash;when
     she appeared on May 13 as a &ldquo;voucher&rdquo; for Elizabeth Claes, who then
     pledged herself to Heraut Wilson, a pump-maker, John Carver being
     one of Wilson&rsquo;s &ldquo;vouchers.&rdquo;  In 1618 Sarah Minther (then recorded as
     the widow of William) reappeared, to plight her troth to Roger
     Simons, brick-maker, from Amsterdam.  These two records and the
     rarity of the name warrant an inference that Desire Minter (or
     Minther) was the daughter of William and Sarah (Willet) Minter (or
     Minther), of Robinson&rsquo;s flock; that her father had died prior to
     1618 (perhaps before 1616); that the Carvers were near friends,
     perhaps kinsfolk; that her father being dead, her mother, a poor
     widow (there were clearly no rich ones in the Leyden congregation),
     placed this daughter with the Carvers, and, marrying herself, and
     removing to Amsterdam the year before the exodus, was glad to leave
     her daughter in so good a home and such hands as Deacon and Mistress
     Carver&rsquo;s.  The record shows that the father and mother of Mrs. Sarah
     Minther, Thomas and Alice Willet, the probable grandparents of
     Desire Minter, appear as &ldquo;vouchers&rdquo; for their daughter at her Leyden
     betrothal.  Of them we know nothing further, but it is a reasonable
     conjecture that they may have returned to England after the
     remarriage of their daughter and her removal to Amsterdam, and the
     removal of the Carvers and their granddaughter to America, and that
     it was to them that Desire went, when, as Bradford records, &ldquo;she
     returned to her friends in England, and proved not very well and
     died there.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Mrs. Carver&rsquo;s maid&rdquo; we know but little about, but the presumption is
     naturally strong that she came from; Leyden with her mistress.  Her
     early marriage and; death are duly recorded.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Roger Wilder, Carver&rsquo;s &ldquo;servant;&rdquo; was apparently in his service at Leyden
     and accompanied the family from thence.  Bradford calls him &ldquo;his
     [Carver&rsquo;s] man Roger,&rdquo; as if an old, familiar household servant,
     which (as Wilder died soon after the arrival at Plymouth) Bradford
     would not have been as likely to do&mdash;writing in 1650, thirty years
     after&mdash;if he had been only a short-time English addition to Carver&rsquo;s
     household, known to Bradford only during the voyage.  The fact that
     he speaks of him as a &ldquo;man&rdquo; also indicates something as to his age,
     and renders it certain that he was not an &ldquo;indentured&rdquo; lad.  It is
     fair to presume he was a passenger on the SPEEDWELL to Southampton.
     (It is probable that Carver&rsquo;s &ldquo;servant-boy,&rdquo; William Latham, and
     Jasper More, his &ldquo;bound-boy,&rdquo; were obtained in England, as more
     fully appears.)
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Master William Bradford and his wife were certainly of the party in the
     SPEEDWELL, as shown by his own recorded account of the embarkation.
     (Bradford&rsquo;s &ldquo;Historie,&rdquo; etc.)
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Master Edward Winslow&rsquo;s very full (published) account of the embarkation
     (&ldquo;Hypocrisie Unmasked,&rdquo; pp. 10-13, etc.) makes it certain that
     himself and family were SPEEDWELL passengers.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
George Soule, who seems to have been a sort of &ldquo;upper servant&rdquo; or
     &ldquo;steward,&rdquo; it is not certain was with Winslow in Holland, though it
     is probable.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Elias Story, his &ldquo;under-servant,&rdquo; was probably also with him in Holland,
     though not surely so.  Both servants might possibly have been
     procured from London or at Southampton, but probably sailed from
     Delfshaven with Winslow in the SPEEDWELL.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Elder William Brewster and his family, his wife and two boys, were
     passengers on the SPEEDWELL, beyond reasonable doubt.  He was, in
     fact, the ranking man of the Leyden brethren till they reached
     Southampton and the respective ships&rsquo; &ldquo;governors&rdquo; were chosen.  The
     Church to that point was dominant.  (The Elder&rsquo;s two &ldquo;bound-boys,&rdquo;
      being from London, do not appear as SPEEDWELL passengers.) There is,
     on careful study, no warrant to be found for the remarkable
     statements of Goodwin (&ldquo;Pilgrim Republic,&rdquo; p. 33), that, during the
     hunt for Brewster in Holland in 1619, by the emissaries of James I.
     of England (in the endeavor to apprehend and punish him for printing
     and publishing certain religious works alleged to be seditious),
     &ldquo;William Brewster was in London .  .  .  and there he remained until
     the sailing of the MAYFLOWER, which he helped to fit out;&rdquo; and that
     during that time &ldquo;he visited Scrooby.&rdquo;  That he had no hand whatever
     in fitting out the MAYFLOWER is certain, and the Scrooby statement
     equally lacks foundation.  Professor Arber, who is certainly a
     better authority upon the &ldquo;hidden press&rdquo; of the Separatists in
     Holland, and the official correspondence relating to its proprietors
     and their movements, says (&ldquo;The Story of the Pilgrim Fathers,&rdquo;
      p.196): &ldquo;The Ruling Elder of the Pilgrim Church was, for more than a
     year before he left Delfshaven on the SPEEDWELL, on the 22 July-
     1 August, 1620, a hunted man.&rdquo;  Again (p. 334), he says: &ldquo;Here let
     us consider the excellent management and strategy of this Exodus.
     If the Pilgrims had gone to London to embark for America, many, if
     not most of them, would have been put in prison [and this is the
     opinion of a British historian, knowing the temper of those times,
     especially William Brewster.]  So only those embarked in London
     against whom the Bishops could take no action.&rdquo;  We can understand,
     in light, why Carver&mdash;a more objectionable person than Cushman to
     the prelates, because of his office in the Separatist Church&mdash;was
     chiefly employed out of their sight, at Southampton, etc., while the
     diplomatic and urbane Cushman did effective work at London, under
     the Bishops&rsquo; eyes.  It is not improbable that the personal
     friendship of Sir Robert Naunton (Principal Secretary of State to
     King James) for Sir Edward Sandys and the Leyden brethren (though
     officially seemingly active under his masters&rsquo; orders in pushing Sir
     Dudley Carleton, the English ambassador at the Hague, to an
     unrelenting search for Brewster) may have been of material aid to
     the Pilgrims in gaining their departure unmolested.  The only basis
     known for the positive expression of Goodwin resides in the
     suggestions of several letters&rsquo; of Sir Dudley Carleton to Sir Robert
     Naunton, during the quest for Brewster; the later seeming clearly to
     nullify the earlier.

     Under date of July 22, 1619, Carleton says: &ldquo;One William Brewster,
     a Brownist, who has been for some years an inhabitant and printer at
     Leyden, but is now within these three weeks removed from thence and
     gone back to dwell in London,&rdquo; etc.

     On August 16, 1619 (N.S.), he writes: &ldquo;I am told William Brewster is
     come again for Leyden,&rdquo; but on the 30th adds: &ldquo;I have made good
     enquiry after William Brewster and am well assured he is not
     returned thither, neither is it likely he will; having removed from
     thence both his family and goods,&rdquo; etc.

     On September 7, 1619 (N.S.), he writes: &ldquo;Touching Brewster, I am now
     informed that he is on this side the seas [not in London, as before
     alleged]; and that he was seen yesterday, at Leyden, but, as yet, is
     not there settled,&rdquo; etc.

     On September 13, 1619 (N.S.), he says: &ldquo;I have used all diligence to
     enquire after Brewster; and find he keeps most at Amsterdam; but
     being &lsquo;incerti laris&rsquo;, he is not yet to be lighted upon.  I
     understand he prepares to settle himself at a village called
     Leerdorp, not far from Leyden, thinking there to be able to print
     prohibited books without discovery, but I shall lay wait for him,
     both there and in other places, so as I doubt but either he must
     leave this country; or I shall, sooner or later, find him out.&rdquo;

     On September 20, 1619 (N.S.), he says: &ldquo;I have at length found out
     Brewster at Leyden,&rdquo; etc.  It was a mistake, and Brewster&rsquo;s partner
     (Thomas Brewer), one of the Merchant Adventurers, was arrested
     instead.

     On September 28, 1619 (N.S.), he states, writing from Amsterdam:
     &ldquo;If he lurk here for fear of apprehension, it will be hard to find
     him,&rdquo; etc.

     As late as February 8, 1619/20, there was still a desire and hope
     for his arrest, but by June the matter had become to the King&mdash;and
     all others&mdash;something of an old story.  While, as appears by a
     letter of Robert Cushman, written in London, in May, 1619, Brewster
     was then undoubtedly there, one cannot agree, in the light of the
     official correspondence just quoted, with the conclusion of Dr.
     Alexander Young (&ldquo;Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,&rdquo; vol. i.
     p. 462), that &ldquo;it is probable he [Brewster] did not return to
     Leyden, but kept close till the MAYFLOWER sailed.&rdquo;

     Everything indicates that he was at Leyden long after this; that he
     did not again return to London, as supposed; and that he was in
     hiding with his family (after their escape from the pursuit at
     Leyden), somewhere among friends in the Low Countries.  Although by
     July, 1620, the King had, as usual, considerably &ldquo;cooled off,&rdquo; we
     may be sure that with full knowledge of the harsh treatment meted
     out to his partner (Brewer) when caught, though unusually mild (by
     agreement with the authorities of the University and Province of
     Holland), Brewster did not deliberately put himself &ldquo;under the
     lion&rsquo;s paw&rdquo; at London, or take any chances of arrest there, even in
     disguise.  Dr. Griffis has lent his assent (&ldquo;The Pilgrims in their
     Homes,&rdquo; p, 167), though probably without careful analysis of all the
     facts, to the untenable opinion expressed by Goodwin, that Brewster
     was &ldquo;hiding in England&rdquo; when the SPEEDWELL sailed from Delfshaven.
     There can be no doubt that, with his ever ready welcome of sound
     amendment, he will, on examination, revise his opinion, as would the
     clear-sighted Goodwin, if living and cognizant of the facts as
     marshalled against his evident error.  As the leader and guide of
     the outgoing part of the Leyden church we may, with good warrant,
     believe&mdash;as all would wish&mdash;that Elder Brewster was the chief figure
     the departing Pilgrims gathered on the SPEEDWELL deck, as she took
     her departure from Delfshaven.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Master Isaac Allerton and his family, his wife and three children, two
     sons and a daughter, were of the Leyden company and passengers in
     the SPEEDWELL.  We know he was active there as a leader, and was
     undoubtedly one of those who bought the SPEEDWELL.  He was one of
     the signers of the joint-letter from Leyden, to Carver and Cushman,
     May 31 (O.S.) 1620.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Hooke, Allerton&rsquo;s &ldquo;servant-lad,&rdquo; may have been detained at London or
     Southampton, but it is hardly probable, as Allerton was a man of
     means, consulted his comfort, and would have hardly started so large
     a family on such a journey without a servant.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Dr. Samuel Fuller was, as is well known, one of the Leyden chiefs,
     connected by blood and marriage with many of the leading families of
     Robinson&rsquo;s congregation.  He was active in the preparations for the
     voyage the first signer of the joint-letter of May 31, and doubtless
     one of the negotiators for the SPEEDWELL.  His wife and child were
     left behind, to follow later as they did.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
William Butten, the first of the Pilgrim party to die, was, in all
     probability, a student-&ldquo;servant&rdquo; of Doctor Fuller at Leyden, and
     doubtless embarked with him at Delfshaven.  Bradford calls him
     (writing of his death) &ldquo;Wm. Butten, a youth, servant to Samuel
     Fuller.&rdquo;  Captain Myles Standish and his wife Rose, we know from
     Bradford, were with the Pilgrims in Leyden and doubtless shipped
     with them.  Arber calls him (&ldquo;The Story of the Pilgrim Fathers,&rdquo;
      p. 378) a &ldquo;chief of the Pilgrim Fathers&rdquo; in the sense of a father
     and leader in their Israel; but there is no warrant for this
     assumption, though he became their &ldquo;sword-hand&rdquo; in the New World.
     By some writers, though apparently with insufficient warrant,
     Standish has been declared a Roman Catholic.  It does not appear
     that he was ever a communicant of the Pilgrim Church. His family,
     moreover, was not of the Roman Catholic faith, and all his conduct
     in the colony is inconsistent with the idea that he was of that
     belief.  Master William White, his wife and son, were of the Leyden
     congregation, both husband and wife being among its principal
     people, and nearly related to several of the Pilgrim band.  The
     marriage of Mr. and Mrs. White is duly recorded in Leyden. William
     Holbeck and Edward Thompson, Master White&rsquo;s two servants, he
     probably took with him from Leyden, as his was a family of means and
     position, though they might possibly have been procured at
     Southampton.  They were apparently passengers in the SPEEDWELL.
     Deacon Thomas Blossom and his son were well known as of Pastor
     Robinson&rsquo;s flock at Leyden.  They returned, moreover, to Holland
     from Plymouth, England (where they gave up the voyage), via London.
     The father went to New Plymouth ten years later, the son dying
     before that time.  (See Blossom&rsquo;s letter to Governor Bradford.
     Bradford&rsquo;s Letter Book, &ldquo;Plymouth Church Records,&rdquo; i. 42.) In his
     letter dated at Leyden, December 15, 1625, he says: &ldquo;God hath taken
     away my son that was with me in the ship MAYFLOWER when I went back
     again.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Edward Tilley (sometimes given the prefix of Master) his wife Ann are
     known to have been of the Leyden company.  (Bradford&rsquo;s &ldquo;Historie,&rdquo;
      p. 83.) It is doubtful if their &ldquo;cousins,&rdquo; Henry Sampson and
     Humility Cooper, were of Leyden.  They apparently were English
     kinsfolk, taken to New England with the Tilleys, very likely joined
     them at Southampton and hence were not of the SPEEDWELL&rsquo;S
     passengers.  Humility Cooper returned to England after the death of
     Tilley and his wife.  That Mrs. Tilley&rsquo;s &ldquo;given name&rdquo; was Ann is not
     positively established, but rests on Bradford&rsquo;s evidence.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Tilley (who is also sometimes called Master) is reputed a brother of
     Edward, and is known to have been&mdash;as also his wife&mdash;of the Leyden
     church (Bradford, Deane&rsquo;s ed.  p. 83.) His second wife Bridget Van
     der Velde, was evidently of Holland blood, and their marriage is
     recorded in Leyden.  Elizabeth Tilley was clearly a daughter by an
     earlier wife.  He is said by Goodwin (&ldquo;Pilgrim Republic,&rdquo; p. 32) to
     have been a &ldquo;silk worker&rdquo; Leyden, but earlier authority for this
     occupation is not found.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Crackstone is of record as of the Leyden congregation.  His daughter
     remained there, and came later to America.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    John Crackstone, Jr., son of above.  Both were SPEEDWELL passengers.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
Francis Cooke has been supposed a very early member of Robinson&rsquo;s flock
     in England, who escaped with them to Holland, in 1608.  He and his
     son perhaps embarked at Delfshaven, leaving his wife and three other
     children to follow later.  (See Robinson&rsquo;s letter to Governor
     Bradford, &ldquo;Mass. Hist. Coll.,&rdquo; vol. iii.  p. 45, also Appendix for
     account of Cooke&rsquo;s marriage.)
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Cooke, the son, was supposed to have lived to be the last male
     survivor of the MAY-FLOWER, but Richard More proves to have survived
     him. He was a prominent man in the colony, like his father, and the
     founder of Dartmouth (Mass.).
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Turner and his sons are also known to have been of the Leyden party,
     as he was undoubtedly the messenger sent to London with the letter
     (of May 31) of the leaders to Carver and Cushman, arriving there
     June 10, 1620.  They were beyond doubt of the SPEEDWELL&rsquo;S list.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Degory Priest&mdash;or &ldquo;Digerie,&rdquo; as Bradford calls him&mdash;was a prominent
     member of the Leyden body.  His marriage is recorded there, and he
     left his family in the care of his pastor and friends, to follow him
     later.  He died early.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Thomas Rogers and his son are reputed of the Leyden company.  He left
     (according to Bradford) some of his family there&mdash;as did Cooke and
     Priest&mdash;to follow later.  It has been suggested that Rogers might
     have been of the Essex (England) lineage, but no evidence of this
     appears.  The Rogers family of Essex were distinctively Puritans,
     both in England and in the Massachusetts colony.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Moses Fletcher was a &ldquo;smith&rdquo; at Leyden, and of Robinson&rsquo;s church.  He was
     married there, in 1613, to his second wife.  He was perhaps of the
     English Amsterdam family of Separatists, of that name.  As the only
     blacksmith of the colonists, his early death was a great loss.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Thomas Williams, there seems no good reason to doubt, was the Thomas
     Williams known to have been of Leyden congregation.  Hon. H. C.
     Murphy and Arber include him&mdash;apparently through oversight alone
     &mdash;in the list of those of Leyden who did not go, unless there were
     two of the name, one of whom remained in Holland.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Thomas Tinker, wife, and son are not certainly known to have been of the
     Leyden company, or to have embarked at Delfshaven, but their
     constant association in close relation with others who were and who
     so embarked warrants the inference that they were of the SPEEDWELL&rsquo;S
     passengers.  It is, however, remotely possible, that they were of
     the English contingent.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Edward Fuller and his wife and little son were of the Leyden company, and
     on the SPEEDWELL.  He is reputed to have been a brother of Dr.
     Fuller, and is occasionally so claimed by early writers, but by what
     warrant is not clear.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Rigdale and his wife have always been placed by tradition and
     association with the Leyden emigrants but there is a possibility
     that they were of the English party.  Probability assigns them to
     the SPEEDWELL, and they are needed to make her accredited number.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Francis Eaton, wife, and babe were doubtless of the Leyden list.  He is
     said to have been a carpenter there (Goodwin, &ldquo;Pilgrim Republic,&rdquo; p.
     32), and was married there, as the record attests.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Peter Browne has always been classed with the Leyden party.  There is no
     established authority for this except tradition, and he might
     possibly have been of the English emigrants, though probably a
     SPEEDWELL passenger; he is needed to make good her putative number.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
William Ring is in the same category as are Eaton and Browne.  Cushman
     speaks of him, in his Dartmouth letter to Edward Southworth (of
     August 17), in terms of intimacy, though this, while suggestive, of
     course proves nothing, and he gave up the voyage and returned from
     Plymouth to London with Cushman.  He was certainly from Leyden.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Richard Clarke is on the doubtful list, as are also John Goodman, Edward
     Margeson, and Richard Britteridge.  They have always been
     traditionally classed with the Leyden colonists, yet some of them
     were possibly among the English emigrants.  They are all needed,
     however, to make up the number usually assigned to Leyden, as are
     all the above &ldquo;doubtfuls,&rdquo; which is of itself somewhat confirmatory
     of the substantial correctness of the list.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Thomas English, Bradford records, &ldquo;was hired to goe master of a [the]
     shallopp&rdquo; of the colonists, in New England waters.  He was probably
     hired in Holland and was almost certainly of the SPEEDWELL.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Alderton (sometimes written Allerton) was, Bradford states, &ldquo;a hired
     man, reputed [reckoned] one of the company, but was to go back
     (being a seaman) and so making no account of the voyages for the
     help of others behind&rdquo; [probably at Leyden].  It is probable that he
     was hired in Holland, and came to Southampton on the SPEEDWELL.
     Both English and Alderton seem to have stood on a different footing
     from Trevore and Ely, the other two seamen in the employ of the
     colonists.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
William Trevore was, we are told by Bradford, &ldquo;a seaman hired to stay a
     year in the countrie,&rdquo; but whether or not as part of the SPEEDWELL&rsquo;S
     Crew (who, he tells us, were all hired for a year) does not appear.
     As the Master (Reynolds) and others of her crew undoubtedly returned
     to London in her from Plymouth, and her voyage was cancelled, the
     presumption is that Trevore and Ely were either hired anew or&mdash;more
     probably&mdash;retained under their former agreement, to proceed by the
     MAY-FLOWER to America, apparently (practically) as passengers.
     Whether of the consort&rsquo;s crew or not, there can be little doubt that
     he left Delfshaven on the SPEEDWELL.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&mdash;- Ely, the other seaman in the Planters&rsquo; employ, also hired to &ldquo;remain
     a year in the countrie,&rdquo; appears to have been drafted, like Trevore,
     from the SPEEDWELL before she returned to London, having, no doubt,
     made passage from Holland in her.  Both Trevore and Ely survived
     &ldquo;the general sickness&rdquo; at New Plimoth, and at the expiration of the
     time for which they were employed returned on the FORTUNE to England

      Of course the initial embarkation, on Friday, July 21/31 1620, was at
      Leyden, doubtless upon the Dutch canal-boats which undoubtedly brought
      them from a point closely adjacent to Pastor Robinson&rsquo;s house in the
      Klock-Steeg (Bell, Belfry, Alley), in the garden of which were the houses
      of many, to Delfshaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rev. John Brown, D.D., says: &ldquo;The barges needed for the journey were most
      likely moored near the Nuns&rsquo; Bridge which spans the Rapenburg immediately
      opposite the Klok-Steeg, where Robinsons house was. This, being their
      usual meeting-place, would naturally be the place of rendezvous on the
      morning of departure. From thence it was but a stone&rsquo;s throw to the boats,
      and quickly after starting they would enter the Vliet, as the section of
      the canal between Leyden and Delft is named, and which for a little
      distance runs within the city bounds, its quays forming the streets. In
      those days the point where the canal leaves the city was guarded by a
      water-gate, which has long since been removed, as have also the town
      walls, the only remaining portions of which are the Morsch-gate and the
      Zylgate. So, gliding along the quiet waters of the Vliet, past the
      Water-gate, and looking up at the frowning turrets of the Cow-gate, &lsquo;they
      left that goodly and pleasant city which had been their resting-place near
      twelve years.&rsquo; . . . Nine miles from Leyden a branch canal connects the
      Vliet with the Hague, and immediately beyond their junction a sharp turn
      is made to the left, as the canal passes beneath the Hoom-bridge; from
      this point, for the remaining five miles, the high road from the Hague to
      Delft, lined with noble trees, runs side by side with the canal. In our
      time the canal-boats make a circuit of the town to the right, but in those
      days the traffic went by canal through the heart of the city . . . .
      Passing out of the gates of Delft and leaving the town behind, they had
      still a good ten miles of canal journey before them ere they reached their
      vessel and came to the final parting, for, as Mr. Van Pelt has clearly
      shown, it is a mistake to confound Delft with Delfshaven, as the point of
      embarkation in the SPEEDWELL. Below Delft the canal, which from Leyden
      thither is the Vliet, then becomes the Schie, and at the village of
      Overschie the travellers entered the Delfshaven Canal, which between
      perfectly straight dykes flows at a considerable height above the
      surrounding pastures. Then finally passing through one set of sluice gates
      after another, the Pilgrims were lifted from the canal into a broad
      receptacle for vessels, then into the outer haven, and so to the side of
      the SPEEDWELL as she lay at the quay awaiting their arrival.&rdquo;

      Dr. Holmes has prettily pictured the &ldquo;Departure&rdquo; in his &ldquo;Robinson of
      Leyden,&rdquo; even if not altogether correctly, geographically.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              &ldquo;He spake; with lingering, long embrace,
               With tears of love and partings fond,
               They floated down the creeping Maas,
               Along the isle of Ysselmond.

              &ldquo;They passed the frowning towers of Briel,
               The &lsquo;Hook of Holland&rsquo;s&rsquo; shelf of sand,
               And grated soon with lifting keel
               The sullen shores of Fatherland.

              &ldquo;No home for these!  too well they knew
               The mitred king behind the throne;
               The sails were set, the pennons flew,
               And westward ho! for worlds unknown.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Winslow informs us that they of the Leyden congregation who volunteered
      for the American enterprise were rather the smaller fraction of the whole
      body, though he adds, as noted &ldquo;that the difference was not great.&rdquo; A
      careful analysis of the approximate list of the Leyden colonists, &mdash;including,
      of course, Carver, and Cushman and his family,&mdash;whose total number
      seems to have been seventy-two, indicates that of this number, forty-two,
      or considerably more than half (the rest being children, seamen, or
      servants), were probably members of the Leyden church. Of these, thirty,
      probably, were males and twelve females. The exact proportion this number
      bore to the numerical strength of Robinson&rsquo;s church at that time cannot be
      determined, because while something less than half as we know, gave their
      votes for the American undertaking, it cannot be known whether or not the
      women of church had a vote in the matter. Presumably they did not, the
      primitive church gave good heed to the words of Paul (i Corinthians xiv.
      34), &ldquo;Let your women keep silence in the churches.&rdquo; Neither can it be
      known&mdash;if they had a voice&mdash;whether the wives and daughters of
      some of the embarking Pilgrims, who did not go themselves at this time,
      voted with their husbands and fathers for the removal. The total number,
      seventy-two, coincides very nearly with the estimate made by Goodwin, who
      says: &ldquo;Only eighty or ninety could go in this party from Leyden,&rdquo; and
      again: &ldquo;Not more than eighty of the MAY-FLOWER company were from Leyden.
      Allowing for [i.e. leaving out] the younger children and servants, it is
      evident that not half the company can have been from Robinson&rsquo;s
      congregation.&rdquo; As the total number of passengers on the MAYFLOWER was one
      hundred and two when she took her final departure from England, it is
      clear that Goodwin&rsquo;s estimate is substantially correct, and that the
      number representing the Leyden church as given above, viz., forty-two, is
      very close to the fact.

      &ldquo;When they came to the place&rdquo; [Delfshaven], says Bradford, &ldquo;they found the
      ship and all things ready; and such of their friends as could not come
      with them [from Leyden] followed after them; and sundry also came from
      Amsterdam (about fifty miles) to see them shipped, and to take their leave
      of them.&rdquo;

      Saturday, July 22/Aug. 1, 1620, the Pilgrim company took their farewells,
      and Winslow records: &ldquo;We only going aboard, the ship lying to the key
      [quay] and ready to sail; the wind being fair, we gave them [their
      friends] a volley of small shot [musketry] and three pieces of ordnance
      and so lifting up our hands to each other and our hearts for each other to
      the Lord our God, we departed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goodwin says of the parting: &ldquo;The hull was wrapped in smoke, through which
      was seen at the stern the white flag of England doubly bisected by the
      great red cross of St. George, a token that the emigrants had at last
      resumed their dearly-loved nationality. Far above them at the main was
      seen the Union Jack of new device.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so after more than eleven years of banishment for conscience&rsquo; sake
      from their native shores, this little band of English exiles, as true to
      their mother-land&mdash;despite persecutions&mdash;as to their God, raised
      the flag of England, above their own little vessel, and under its folds
      set sail to plant themselves for a larger life in a New World.

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S CHARTER AND THE ADVENTURERS
    </h3>
    <p>
      The ship MAY-FLOWER was evidently chartered about the middle of June, 1620
      at London, by Masters Thomas West Robert Cushman acting together in behalf
      of the Merchant Adventurers (chiefly of London) and the English
      congregation of &ldquo;Separatists&rdquo; (the &ldquo;Pilgrims&rdquo;), at Leyden in Holland who,
      with certain of England associated, proposed to colony in America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Arber, when he says, in speaking of Cushman and Weston, &ldquo;the
      hiring of the MAY-FLOWER, when they did do it, was their act alone, and
      the Leyden church nothing to do with it,&rdquo; seems to forget that Cushman and
      his associate Carver had no other function or authority in their
      conjunction with Weston and Martin, except to represent the Leyden
      congregation. Furthermore, it was the avowed wish of Robinson (see his
      letter dated June 14, 1620, to John Carver), that Weston &ldquo;may [should]
      presently succeed in hiring&rdquo; [a ship], which was equivalent to hoping that
      Carver and Cushman&mdash;Weston&rsquo;s associates representing Leyden&mdash;would
      aid in so doing. Moreover, Bradford expressly states that: &ldquo;Articles of
      Agreement, drawn by themselves were, by their [the Leyden congregation&rsquo;s]
      said messenger [Carver] sent into England, who together with Robert
      Cushman were to receive moneys and make provisions, both for shipping, and
      other things for the voyage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up to Saturday, June 10, nothing had been effected in the way of providing
      shipping for the migrating planters though the undertaking had been four
      months afoot&mdash;beyond the purchase and refitting, in Holland, by the
      Leyden people themselves, of a pinnace of sixty tons (the SPEEDWELL)
      intended as consort to a larger ship&mdash;and the hiring of a &ldquo;pilott&rdquo; to
      refit her, as we have seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Leyden leaders had apparently favored purchasing also the larger
      vessel still needed for the voyage, hoping, perhaps, to interest therein
      at least one of their friends, Master Edward Pickering, a merchant of
      Holland, himself one of the Adventurers, while Master Weston had, as
      appears, inclined to hire. From this disagreement and other causes,
      perhaps certain sinister reasons, Weston had become disaffected, the
      enterprise drooped, the outlook was dubious, and several formerly
      interested drew back, until shipping should be provided and the good faith
      of the enterprise be thus assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      It transpires from Robinson&rsquo;s letter dated June 14., before quoted (in
      which he says: &ldquo;For shipping, Master Weston, it should seem is set upon
      hiring&rdquo;), that Robinson&rsquo;s own idea was to purchase, and he seems to have
      dominated the rest. There is perhaps a hint of his reason for this in the
      following clause of the same letter, where he writes: &ldquo;I do not think
      Master Pickering [the friend previously named] will ingage, except in the
      course of buying [&lsquo;ships?&rsquo;&mdash;Arber interpolates] as in former letters
      specified.&rdquo; If he had not then &ldquo;ingaged&rdquo; (as Robinson intimates), as an
      Adventurer, he surely did later, contrary to the pastor&rsquo;s prediction, and
      the above may have been a bit of special pleading. Robinson naturally
      wished to keep their, affairs, so far as possible, in known and supposedly
      friendly hands, and had possibly some assurances that, as a merchant,
      Pickering would be willing to invest in a ship for which he could get a
      good charter for an American voyage. He proved rather an unstable friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robinson is emphatic, in the letter cited, as to the imperative necessity
      that shipping should be immediately provided if the enterprise was to be
      held together and the funds subscribed were to be secured. He evidently
      considered this the only guaranty of good faith and of an honest intention
      to immediately transport the colony over sea, that would be accepted.
      After saying, as already noted, that those behind-hand with their payments
      refuse to pay in &ldquo;till they see shipping provided or a course taken for
      it,&rdquo; he adds, referring to Master Weston: &ldquo;That he should not have had
      either shipping ready before this time, or at least certain [i.e.
      definite] means and course, and the same known to us, for it; or have
      taken other order otherwise; cannot in [according to] my conscience be
      excused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bradford also states that one Master Thomas Weston a merchant of London,
      came to Leyden about the same time [apparently while negotiations for
      emigration under their auspices were pending with the Dutch, in February
      or March, 1620], who was &ldquo;well acquainted with some of them and a
      furtherer of them in their former proceedings.... and persuaded them....
      not to meddle with the Dutch,&rdquo; etc. This Robinson confirms in his letter
      to Carver before referred to, saying: &ldquo;You know right well we depend on
      Master Weston alone,.... and when we had in hand another course with the
      Dutchman, broke it off at his motion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the 10th of June, 1620, Robert Cushman, one of the
      Leyden agents at London, after writing to his associate, Master John
      Carver, then at Southampton; and to the Leyden leaders&mdash;in reply to
      certain censorious letters received by him from both these sources &mdash;although
      disheartened by the difficulties and prospects before him, sought Master
      Weston, and by an urgent appeal so effectively wrought upon him, that, two
      hours later, coming to Cushman, he promised &ldquo;he would not yet give it [the
      undertaking] up.&rdquo; Cushman&rsquo;s patience and endurance were evidently nearly
      &ldquo;at the breaking point,&rdquo; for he says in his letter of Sunday, June 11,
      when success had begun to crown his last grand effort: &ldquo;And, indeed, the
      many discouragements I find here [in London] together with the demurs and
      retirings there [at Leyden] had made me to say, &lsquo;I would give up my
      accounts to John Carver and at his coming from Southampton acquaint him
      fully with all courses [proceedings] and so leave it quite, with only the
      poor clothes on my back: But gathering up myself by further consideration,
      I resolved yet to make one trial more,&rdquo; etc. It was this &ldquo;one trial more&rdquo;
       which meant so much to the Pilgrims; to the cause of Religion; to America;
      and to Humanity. It will rank with the last heroic and successful efforts
      of Robert the Bruce and others, which have become historic. The effect of
      Cushman&rsquo;s appeal upon Weston cannot be doubted. It not only apparently
      influenced him at the time, but, after reflection and the lapse of hours,
      it brought him to his associate to promise further loyalty, and, what was
      much better, to act. The real animus of Weston&rsquo;s backwardness, it is quite
      probable, lay in the designs of Gorges, which were probably not yet fully
      matured, or, if so, involved delay as an essential part. &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; Cushman
      states, &ldquo;advising together, we resolved to hire a ship.&rdquo; They evidently
      found one that afternoon, &ldquo;of sixty last&rdquo; (120 tons) which was called &ldquo;a
      fine ship,&rdquo; and which they &ldquo;took liking of [Old English for trial
      (Dryden), equivalent to refusal] till Monday.&rdquo; The same afternoon they
      &ldquo;hired another pilot . . . one Master Clarke.&rdquo;&mdash;of whom further.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems certain that by the expression, &ldquo;we have hired another pilot
      here, one Master Clarke,&rdquo; etc.; that Cushman was reckoning the &ldquo;pilott&rdquo;
       Reynolds whom he had hired and sent over to them in Holland, as shown&mdash;as
      at the first, and now Clarke as &ldquo;another.&rdquo; It nowhere appears that up to
      this date, any other than these two had been hired, nor had there been
      until then, any occasion for more than one.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Cushman had been engaged in such important negotiations as these before
      he wrote his letters to Carver and the Leyden friends, on Saturday
      morning, he would certainly have mentioned them. As he named neither, it
      is clear that they had not then occurred. It is equally certain that
      Cushman&rsquo;s appeal to Weston was not made, and his renewed activity aroused,
      until after these letters had been dispatched and nothing of the kind
      could have been done without Weston.
    </p>
    <p>
      His letter-writing of June 10 was obviously in the morning, as proven by
      the great day&rsquo;s work Cushman performed subsequently. He must have written
      his letters early and have taken them to such place as his messenger had
      suggested (Who his messenger was does not appear, but it was not John
      Turner, as suggested by Arber, for he did not arrive till that night.)
      Cushman must then have looked up Weston and had an hour or more of earnest
      argument with him, for he says: &ldquo;at the last [as if some time was
      occupied] he gathered himself up a little more&rdquo; [i.e. yielded somewhat.]
      Then came an interval of &ldquo;two hours,&rdquo; at the end of which Weston came to
      him,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [It would be highly interesting to know whether, in the two hours
     which intervened between Cushman&rsquo;s call on Weston and the latter&rsquo;s
     return call, Weston consulted Gorges and got his instructions.  It
     is certain that he came prepared to act, and that vigorously, which
     he had not previously been.]
</pre>
    <p>
      <br /> and they &ldquo;advised together,&rdquo;&mdash;which took time. It was by this
      evidently somewhat past noon, a four or five hours having been consumed.
      They then went to look for a ship and found one, which, from Cushman&rsquo;s
      remark, &ldquo;but a fine ship it is,&rdquo; they must (at least superficially) have
      examined. While hunting for the ship they seem to have come across, and to
      have hired, John Clarke the &ldquo;pilot,&rdquo; with whom they necessarily, as with
      the ship&rsquo;s people, spent some time. It is not improbable that the approach
      of dusk cut short their examination of the ship, which they hence &ldquo;took
      liking of [refusal of] till Monday.&rdquo; It is therefore evident that the
      &ldquo;refusal&rdquo; of the &ldquo;sixty last&rdquo; ship was taken, and the &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; Clarke was
      &ldquo;hired,&rdquo; on Saturday afternoon, June 10, as on Sunday, June 11, Cushman
      informed the Leyden leaders of these facts by letter, as above indicated,
      and gave instructions as to the SPEEDWELL&rsquo;S &ldquo;pilott,&rdquo; Master Reynolds.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are therefore able to fix, nearly to an hour, the &ldquo;turning of the tide&rdquo;
       in the affairs of the Pilgrim movement to America.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also altogether probable that the Pilgrims and humanity at large are
      still further (indirectly) indebted to Cushman&rsquo;s &ldquo;one more trial&rdquo; and
      resultant Saturday afternoon&rsquo;s work, for the MAY-FLOWER (though not found
      that day), and her able commander Jones, who, whatever his faults, safely
      brought the Pilgrims through stormy seas to their &ldquo;promised land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Obligations of considerable and rapidly cumulative cost had now been
      incurred, making it imperative to go forward to embarkation with all
      speed, and primarily, to secure the requisite larger ship. Evidently
      Weston and Cushman believed they had found one that would serve, when on
      Saturday, they &ldquo;took liking,&rdquo; as we have seen, of the &ldquo;fine ship&rdquo; of 120
      tons, &ldquo;till Monday.&rdquo; No less able authorities than Charles Deane, Goodwin,
      and Brown, with others, have mistakenly concluded that this ship was the
      MAY-FLOWER, and have so stated in terms. As editor of Bradford&rsquo;s history
      &ldquo;Of Plimoth Plantation,&rdquo; Mr. Deane (in a footnote to the letter of Cushman
      written Sunday, June 11), after quoting the remark, &ldquo;But it is a fine
      ship,&rdquo; mistakenly adds, &ldquo;The renowned MAYFLOWER.&mdash;Ed.,&rdquo; thus
      committing himself to the common error in this regard. John Brown, in his
      &ldquo;Pilgrim Fathers of New England,&rdquo; confuses the vessels, stating that,
      &ldquo;when all was ready for the start, a pilot came over to conduct the
      emigrants to England, bringing also a letter from Cushman announcing that
      the MAYFLOWER, a vessel of one hundred and eighty tons, Thomas Jones,
      Master, would start from London to Southampton in a week or two,&rdquo; etc. As
      we have seen, these statements are out of their relation. No pilot went
      for that purpose and none carried such a letter (certainly none from
      Cushman), as alleged. Cushman&rsquo;s letter, sent as we know by John Turner,
      announced the finding of an entirely different vessel, which was neither
      of 180 tons burden, nor had any relation to the MAY-FLOWER or her future
      historic freight. Neither was there in his letter any time of starting
      mentioned, or of the port of Southampton as the destination of any vessel
      to go from London, or of Jones as captain. Such loose statements are the
      bane of history. Goodwin, usually so accurate, stumbles unaccountably in
      this matter&mdash;which has been so strangely misleading to other
      competent men&mdash;and makes the sadly perverted statement that, &ldquo;In
      June, John Turner was sent, and he soon returned with a petulant (sic)
      letter from Cushman, which, however, announced that the ship MAYFLOWER had
      been selected and in two weeks would probably leave London for
      Southampton.&rdquo; He adds, with inexcusable carelessness in the presence of
      the words &ldquo;sixty last&rdquo; (which his dictionary would have told him, at a
      glance, was 120 tons), that: &ldquo;This vessel (Thomas Jones, master) was rated
      at a hundred and eighty tons . . . . Yet she was called a fine ship,&rdquo; etc.
      It is evident that, like Brown, he confused the two vessels, with
      Cushman&rsquo;s letter before his eyes, from failure to compute the &ldquo;sixty
      last.&rdquo; He moreover quotes Cushman incorrectly. The great disparity in
      size, however, should alone render this confusion impossible, and Cushman
      is clear as to the tonnage (&ldquo;sixty last&rdquo;), regretting that the ship found
      is not larger, while Bradford and all other chroniclers agree that the
      MAY-FLOWER was of &ldquo;9 score&rdquo; tons burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also evident that for some reason this smaller ship (found on
      Saturday afternoon) was not taken, probably because the larger one, the
      MAY-FLOWER, was immediately offered to and secured by Masters Weston and
      Cushman, and very probably with general approval. Just how the MAY-FLOWER
      was obtained may never be certainly known. It was only on Saturday, June
      10, as we have seen, that Master Weston had seriously set to work to look
      for a ship; and although the refusal of one&mdash;not wholly satisfactory&mdash;had
      been prudently taken that day, it was both natural and politic that as
      early as possible in the following week he should make first inquiry of
      his fellow-merchants among the Adventurers, whether any of them had
      available such a ship as was requisite, seeking to find, if possible, one
      more nearly of the desired capacity than that of which he had &ldquo;taken the
      refusal&rdquo; on Saturday. It appears altogether probable that, in reply to
      this inquiry, Thomas Goffe, Esq., a fellow Adventurer and
      shipping-merchant of London, offered the MAY-FLOWER, which, there is ample
      reason to believe, then and for ten years thereafter, belonged to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is quite likely that Clarke, the newly engaged &ldquo;pilot,&rdquo; learning that
      his employers required a competent commander for their ship, brought to
      their notice the master of the ship (the FALCON) in which he had made his
      recent voyage to Virginia, Captain Jones, who, having powerful friends at
      his back in both Virginia Companies (as later appears), and large
      experience, was able to approve himself to the Adventurers. It is also
      probable that Thomas Weston engaged him himself, on the recommendation of
      the Earl of Warwick, at the instance of Sir Ferdinando Gorges.
    </p>
    <p>
      As several weeks would be required to fit the ship for her long voyage on
      such service, and as she sailed from London July 15, her charter-party
      must certainly have been signed by June 20, 1620. The SPEEDWELL, as
      appears from various sources (Bradford, Winslow et al.), sailed from
      Delfshaven, Saturday, July 22. She is said to have been four days on the
      passage to Southampton, reaching there Wednesday, July 26. Cushman, in his
      letter of Thursday, August 17, from Dartmouth to Edward Southworth, says,
      &ldquo;We lay at Southampton seven days waiting for her&rdquo; (the SPEEDWELL), from
      which it is evident, both that Cushman came on the MAY-FLOWER from London,
      and that the MAY-FLOWER must have left London at least ten days before the
      26th of July, the date of the SPEEDWELL&rsquo;S arrival. As given traditionally,
      it was on the 15th, or eleven days before the SPEEDWELL&rsquo;S arrival at
      Southampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      By whom the charter-party of the MAY-FLOWER was signed will probably
      remain matter of conjecture, though we are not without intimations of some
      value regarding it. Captain John Smith tells us that the Merchant
      Adventurers (presumably one of the contracting parties) &ldquo;were about
      seventy, . . . not a Corporation, but knit together by a voluntary
      combination in a Society without constraint or penalty. They have a
      President and Treasurer every year newly chosen by the most voices, who
      ordereth the affairs of their Courts and meetings; and with the assent of
      most of them, undertaketh all the ordinary business, but in more weighty
      affairs, the assent of the whole Company is required.&rdquo; It would seem from
      the foregoing&mdash;which, from so intelligent a source at a date so
      contemporaneous, ought to be reliable&mdash;that, not being an
      incorporated body, it would be essential that all the Adventurers (which
      Smith expressly states was their rule) should &ldquo;assent&rdquo; by their
      signatures, which alone could bind them to so important a business
      document as this charter-party. It was certainly one of their &ldquo;more
      weighty affairs,&rdquo; and it may well be doubted, also, if the owner of the
      vessel (even though one of their number) would accept less than the
      signatures of all, when there was no legal status by incorporation or
      co-partnership to hold them collectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the facts were indeed as stated by Smith,&mdash;whose knowledge of what
      he affirmed there is no reason to doubt,&mdash;there can be little
      question that the contract for the service of the MAY-FLOWER was signed by
      the entire number of the Adventurers on the one part. If so, its covenants
      would be equally binding upon each of them except as otherwise therein
      stipulated, or provided by the law of the realm. In such case, the
      charter-party of the MAY-FLOWER, with the autograph of each Merchant
      Adventurer appended, would constitute, if it could be found, one of the
      most interesting and valuable of historical documents. That it was not
      signed by any of the Leyden congregation&mdash;in any representative
      capacity&mdash;is well-nigh certain. Their contracts were with the
      Adventurers alone, and hence they were not directly concerned in the
      contracts of the latter, their &ldquo;agents&rdquo; being but co-workers with the
      Adventurers (under their partnership agreements), in finding shipping,
      collecting moneys, purchasing supplies, and in generally promoting the
      enterprise. That they were not signing-parties to this contract, in
      particular, is made very certain by the suggestion of Cushman&rsquo;s letter of
      Sunday, June 11, to the effect that he hoped that &ldquo;our friends there [at
      Leyden] if they be quitted of the ship-hire [as then seemed certain, as
      the Adventurers would hire on general account] will be induced to venture
      [invest] the more.&rdquo; There had evidently been a grave fear on the part of
      the Leyden people that if they were ever to get away, they would have to
      hire the necessary ship themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is just the shadow of a doubt thrown upon the accuracy of Smith&rsquo;s
      statement as to the non-corporate status of the Adventurers, by the loose
      and unwieldy features which must thereby attach to their business
      transactions, to which it seems probable that merchants like Weston,
      Andrews, Beauchamp, Shirley, Pickering, Goffe, and others would object,
      unless the law at that time expressly limited and defined the rights and
      liabilities of members in such voluntary associations. Neither evidences
      of (primary) incorporation, or of such legal limitation, have, however,
      rewarded diligent search. There was evidently some more definite and
      corporate form of ownership in the properties and values of the
      Adventurers, arrived at later. A considerable reduction in the number of
      proprietors was effected before 1624&mdash;in most cases by the purchase
      of the interests of certain ones by their associates&mdash;for we find
      their holdings spoken of in that year as &ldquo;sixteenths,&rdquo; and these shares to
      have sometimes been attached for their owners&rsquo; debts. A letter of Shirley,
      Brewer et als., to Bradford, Allerton et als., dated London, April 7,
      1624, says: &ldquo;If it had not been apparently sold, Mr. Beauchamp, who is of
      the company also, unto whom he [Weston] oweth a great deal more, had long
      ago attached it (as he did other&rsquo;s 16ths),&rdquo; etc. It is exceedingly
      difficult to reconcile these unquestionable facts with the equal certainty
      that, at the &ldquo;Composition&rdquo; of the Adventurers with the Planters in 1626,
      there were forty-two who signed as of the Adventurers. The weight,
      however, of evidence and of probability must be held to support the
      conclusion that in June, 1620, the organization was voluntary, and that
      the charter-party of the MAY-FLOWER was signed&mdash;&rdquo; on the one part &ldquo;&mdash;by
      each of the enrolled Adventurers engaged in the Leyden congregation&rsquo;s
      colonization scheme. Goodwin&rsquo; alone pretends to any certain knowledge of
      the matter, but although a veracious usually reliable writer, he is not
      infallible, as already shown, and could hardly have had access to the
      original documents,&mdash;which alone, in this case, could be relied on to
      prove his assertion that &ldquo;Shortly articles were signed by both parties,
      Weston acting for the Adventurers.&rdquo; Not a particle of confirmatory
      evidence has anywhere been found in Pilgrim or contemporaneous literature
      to warrant this statement, after exhaustive search, and it must hence,
      until sustained by proof, be regarded as a personal inference rather than
      a verity. If the facts were as appears, they permit the hope that a
      document of so much prima facie importance may have escaped destruction,
      and will yet be found among the private papers of some of the last
      survivors of the Adventurers, though with the acquisition of all their
      interests by the Pilgrim leaders such documents would seem, of right, to
      have become the property of the purchasers, and to have been transferred
      to the Plymouth planters.
    </p>
    <p>
      This all-important and historic body&mdash;the company of Merchant
      Adventurers&mdash;is entitled to more than passing notice. Associated to
      &ldquo;finance&rdquo; the projected transplantation of the Leyden congregation of
      &ldquo;Independents&rdquo; to the &ldquo;northern parts of Virginia,&rdquo; under such patronage
      and protection of the English government and its chartered Companies as
      they might be able to secure, they were no doubt primarily brought
      together by the efforts of one of their number, Thomas Weston, Esq., the
      London merchant previously named, though for some obscure reason Master
      John Pierce (also one of them) was their &ldquo;recognized&rdquo; representative in
      dealing with the (London) Virginia Company and the Council for the Affairs
      of New England, in regard to their Patents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradford states that Weston &ldquo;was well acquainted with some of them the
      Leyden leaders and a furtherer of them in their former proceedings,&rdquo; and
      this fact is more than once referred to as ground for their gratitude and
      generosity toward him, though where, or in what way, his friendship had
      been exercised, cannot be learned,&mdash;perhaps in the difficulties
      attending their escape from &ldquo;the north country&rdquo; to Holland. It was
      doubtless largely on this account, that his confident assurances of all
      needed aid in their plans for America were so relied upon; that he was so
      long and so fully trusted; and that his abominable treachery and later
      abuse were so patiently borne.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are indebted to the celebrated navigator, Captain John Smith, of
      Virginia fame, always the friend of the New England colonists, for most of
      what we know of the organization and purposes of this Company. His ample
      statement, worthy of repetition here, recites, that &ldquo;the Adventurers which
      raised the stock to begin and supply this Plantation, were about seventy:
      some, Gentlemen; some, Merchants; some, handicraftsmen; some adventuring
      great sums, some, small; as their estates and affections served . . . .
      These dwell most about London. They are not a corporation but knit
      together, by a voluntary combination, in a Society, with out constraint or
      penalty; aiming to do good and to plant Religion.&rdquo; Their organization,
      officers, and rules of conduct, as given by Smith, have already been
      quoted. It is to be feared from the conduct of such men as Weston, Pierce,
      Andrews, Shirley, Thornell, Greene, Pickering, Alden, and others, that
      profitable investment, rather than desire &ldquo;to do good and to plant
      Religion,&rdquo; was their chief interest. That the higher motives mentioned by
      Smith governed such tried and steadfast souls as Bass, Brewer, Collier,
      Fletcher, Goffe, Hatherly, Ling, Mullens, Pocock, Thomas, and a few
      others, there can be no doubt.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Weston wrote Bradford, April 10, 1622, &ldquo;I perceive and know as well
     as another ye disposition of your adventurers, whom ye hope of gaine
     hath drawne on to this they have done; and yet I fear ye hope will
     not draw them much further.&rdquo;  While Weston&rsquo;s character was utterly
     bad, and he had then alienated his interest in both Pilgrims and
     Adventurers, his judgment of men was evidently good.]

    <p>
      No complete list of the original &ldquo;seventy&rdquo; has ever been found, and we are
      indebted for the names of forty-two, of the fifty who are now known, to
      the final &ldquo;Composition&rdquo; made with the Pilgrim colonists, through the
      latter&rsquo;s representatives, November 15/25, 1626, as given by Bradford, and
      to private research for the rest. The list of original members of the
      company of Merchant Adventurers, as ascertained to date, is as follows.
      More extended mention of them appears in the notes appended to this list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert Allden, Thomas Fletcher, Emanuel Altham, Thomas Goffe, Richard
      Andrews, Peter Gudburn, Thomas Andrews, William Greene, Lawrence Anthony,
      Timothy Hatherly, Edward Bass, Thomas Heath, John Beauchamp, William
      Hobson, Thomas Brewer, Robert Holland, Henry Browning, Thomas Hudson,
      William Collier, Robert Keayne, Thomas Coventry, Eliza Knight, John
      Knight, John Revell, Miles Knowles, Newman Rookes, John Ling, Samuel

      Shirley, in a letter to Governor Bradford, mentions a Mr. Fogge and a Mr.
      Coalson, in a way to indicate that they might have been, like himself,
      Collier, Thomas, Hatherly, Beauchamp, and Andrews, also of the original
      Merchant Adventurers, but no proof that they were such has yet been
      discovered. It has been suggested that Sir Edwin Sandys was one of the
      number, at the inception of the enterprise, but&mdash;though there is
      evidence to indicate that he stood the friend of the Pilgrims in many
      ways, possibly lending them money, etc.&mdash;there is no proof that he
      was ever one of the Adventurers. It is more probable that certain
      promoters of Higginson&rsquo;s and Winthrop&rsquo;s companies, some ten years later,
      were early financial sponsers of the MAY-FLOWER Pilgrims. Some of them
      were certainly so, and it is likely that others not known as such, in
      reality, were. Bradford suggests, in a connection to indicate the
      possibility of his having been an &ldquo;Adventurer,&rdquo; the name of a &ldquo;Mr.
      Denison,&rdquo; of whom nothing more is known. George Morton of London,
      merchant, and friend of the leaders from the inception, and later a
      colonist, is sometimes mentioned as probably of the list, but no evidence
      of the fact as yet appears. Sir George Farrer and his brother were among
      the first of the Adventurers, but withdrew themselves and their
      subscriptions very early, on account of some dissatisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible, in the space at command, to give more than briefest
      mention of each of these individual Adventurers.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Allden.  Was at one time unfriendly to the Pilgrims,&mdash;Bradford calls him
     &ldquo;one of our powerfullest opposers,&rdquo;&mdash;but later their ally.  Little
     is known of him. He appears to have been of London.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Altham.  Was Master of the pinnace LITTLE JAMES, belonging chiefly to
     Fletcher, and apparently expected to command her on her voyage to
     New Plymouth in 1623, as consort of the ANNE, but for some reason
     did not go, and William Bridge went as her Master, in his stead.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Andrews (Richard).  Was one of the wealthiest and most liberal of the
     Adventurers.  He was a haberdasher of Cheapside, London, and an
     Alderman of the city. He became an early proprietor and liberal
     benefactor of the Massachusetts Bay Company, but most illogically
     gave the debt due him from Plymouth Colony (L540) to the stronger
     and richer Bay Colony.  He had been, however, unjustly prejudiced
     against the Pilgrims, probably through the deceit of Pierce, Weston,
     Shirley, and Allerton.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Andrews (Thomas).  A Lord Mayor of London, reputed a brother of the
     last-named.  Never very active in the Adventurers&rsquo; affairs, but
     friendly, so far as appears.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Anthony.  Little or nothing is known concerning him.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Bass.  Was one of the enduring friends of the struggling Colony and
     loaned them money when they were in dire straits and the prospect of
     recovery was not good.  He was of London, and considerable is known
     concerning him.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Beauchamp.  Was one of the most active of the Company for many years.
     Generally to be relied upon as the Colony&rsquo;s friend, but not without
     some sordid self seeking.  Apparently a wealthy citizen and &ldquo;salter&rdquo;
      of London.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Brewer.  Is too well-known as long the partner of Brewster in the conduct
     of the &ldquo;hidden press&rdquo; at Leyden, and as a sufferer for conscience&rsquo;
     sake, to require identification.  He was a wealthy man, a scholar,
     writer, printer, and publisher.  Was of the University of Leyden,
     but removed to London after the departure of the chief of the
     Pilgrims.  Was their stanch friend, a loyal defender of the faith,
     and spent most of his later life in prison, under persecution of the
     Bishops.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Browning.  Does not appear to have been active, and little is known of
     him.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Collier.  Was a stanch and steadfast friend.  Finally cast in his lot
     with the Pilgrims at New Plymouth and became a leading man in the
     government there.  His life is well known.  He was a &ldquo;brewer.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Coventry.  Appears only as a signer, and nothing is known of him.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Fletcher.  Was a well-to-do merchant of London, a warm friend and a
     reliance of the Pilgrims.  The loss of the LITTLE JAMES was a severe
     blow to him financially.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Greene.  Appears to have been a merchant and a partner in Holland (and
     perhaps at London) of Edward Pickering.  They were well acquainted
     personally with the Pilgrims, and should have been among their most
     liberal and surest friends.  Facts indicate, however, that they were
     sordid in their interest and not entirely just.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Goffe.  Was a London merchant and ship-owner, as else where appears.
     He was not only a Merchant Adventurer, but a patentee and
     deputy-governor of the Massachusetts Company, and an intimate
     friend of Winthrop.  He lost heavily by his New England ventures.
     There is, as shown elsewhere, good reason to believe that he was
     the owner of the MAY-FLOWER on her historic voyage, as also when
     she came over in Higginson&rsquo;s and Winthrop&rsquo;s fleets, ten years
     later.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Gudburn.  Appears only as a signer, so far as known.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Hatherly.  Was a well-to-do friend of the Pilgrims, and after many
     complaints had been made against them among the &ldquo;Purchasers&rdquo;
      &mdash;arising out of the rascality of Shirley and Allerton&mdash;went to New
     England on a mission of inquiry.  He was perfectly convinced of the
     Pilgrims&rsquo; integrity and charmed with the country.  He made another
     visit, and removed thither in 1633, to remain.  He became at once
     prominent in the government of New Plimoth Colony.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Heath.  Does not appear to have been active, and naught is known of him.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Hobson.  Is known only as a signer of the &ldquo;Composition.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Holland.  Was a friend and ally of the Pilgrims, and one of their
     correspondents.  He is supposed to have been of the ancient house of
     that name and to have lived in London.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Hudson.  Was not active, and appears as a signer only.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Keayne.  Was a well-to-do citizen of the vicinity of London, a friend, in
     a general way, of the Pilgrims.  He came to Boston with Winthrop.
     Was prominent in the Massachusetts Colony.  Was the founder and
     first commander of the early Artillery Company of Boston, the oldest
     military organization of the United States, and died at Boston,
     leaving a large estate and a very remarkable will, of which he made
     Governor Winslow an &ldquo;overseer.&rdquo;  He was an erratic,&mdash;but valuable,
     citizen.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Knight (Eliza).  Seems to have been the only woman of the Adventurers, so
     far as they are known, but no thing is known of her.  It has been
     suggested that the given name has been wrongly spelled and should be
     &ldquo;Eleazar,&rdquo;&mdash;a man&rsquo;s name,&mdash;but the &ldquo;Composition&rdquo; gives the signature
     as Eliza, clearly, as published.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Knight (John).  Finds no especial mention.  He was probably a relative of
     Eliza.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Knowles.  Appears only as a signer of the &ldquo;Composition.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Ling.  Was a wealthy friend of the colonists and always true to them.  He
     lost his property and was in poverty when the Pilgrims (though not
     yet well on their feet), in grateful remembrance of his fidelity,
     sent him a generous gift.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Martin.  Was the first treasurer of the colonists and also a MAY-FLOWER
     Pilgrim.  Mention of him appears later. He was no credit to the
     Company, and his early death probably prevented much vexation.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Millsop.  Appears only as a signer of the &ldquo;Composition.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Mott.  Has no especial mention, but is believed to have sent some of his
     people to Plymouth Colony at an early day.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Mullens.  Was, as appears elsewhere, a well-conditioned tradesman of
     Surrey, England, who was both an Adventurer and a MAY-FLOWER
     Pilgrim, and Martin and himself appear to have been the only ones
     who enjoyed that distinction.  He died, however, soon after the
     arrival at Plymouth.  That he was an Adventurer is but recently
     discovered by the author, but there appears no room for doubt as to
     the fact. His record was brief, but satisfactory, in its relation to
     the Pilgrims.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Newbald.  Finds no especial mention.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Pennington.  Appears only as a signer.  It is a London name.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Penrin.  Appears only as a signer of the &ldquo;Composition.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Pickering.  Is introduced to us first as a Leyden merchant, through John
     Robinson&rsquo;s letters.  He appears to have been a shrewd, cold-blooded
     calculator, like his partner-Adventurer, Greene, not interested
     especially in the Pilgrims, except for gain, and soon deserting the
     Adventurers.  His family seem to have been in favor with Charles II.
     (See Pepys&rsquo; &ldquo;Diary.&rdquo;)
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Pierce (John).  Although recognized by the Virginia Companies and Council
     for New England, as the representative of the Adventurers, he has
     only been recently generally reckoned a chief man of the
     Adventurers. A Protean friend of the Pilgrims, never reliable, ever
     pretentious, always self-seeking, and of no help. He was finally
     ruined by the disasters to his ship, the PARAGON, which cost him all
     his interests.  Having attempted treacherously to secure to himself
     the Patent granted in the Colony&rsquo;s interest, he was compelled by the
     Council to surrender its advantages to the Adventurers and
     colonists.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Pocock.  Was a stanch and firm supporter of the Pilgrims and their
     interests, at all times, and to the end.  He was also a financial
     supporter and deputy-governor  the Massachusetts Company, under
     Winthrop.  A correspondent of Bradford.  A good man.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Poyton.  Finds no especial mention.  He appears as a signer only.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Quarles.  Appears only as a signer of the &ldquo;Composition.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Revell.  Was a very wealthy citizen, merchant, and ship owner of London,
     and a good man.  He became also ardently interested in Winthrop&rsquo;s
     Company.  Was an &ldquo;assistant&rdquo; and one of the five &ldquo;undertakers&rdquo;
      chosen to go to New England to reside.  He went to New England on
     the JEWELL of Winthrop&rsquo;s fleet, and was part owner of the LADY
     ARBELLA.  He evidently, however, did not like the life, and returned
     after a few weeks&rsquo; stay.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Rookes.  Appears only as a signer.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Sharpe.  Was also a friend of both Pilgrim and Puritan. He came to New
     England in 1629, and settled first at Salem, in the Massachusetts
     Company.  He died in 1658, having long been a ruling elder of the
     church there.  He met with many enemies, but was a valuable man and
     an able one.  He was Governor Cradock&rsquo;s New England agent.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Shirley.  Requires little mention here.  The perfidious friend of the
     Pilgrims,&mdash;perhaps originally true to them,&mdash;he sunk everything for
     hope of gain.  He was treasurer of the Adventurers, one of their
     most active and intelligent men, but proved a rascal and a canting
     hypocrite.  He was a &ldquo;citizen and gold-smith&rdquo; of London.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Thomas.  Has nowhere been enumerated in any list of the Adventurers
     (though occasionally mentioned as such by recent writers), which is
     strange, as repeated letters of his to Bradford, and other data,
     show him to have been one of the best and truest of them all.  He
     sold his interests before the &ldquo;Composition&rdquo; and became a colonist
     after 1630.  He was the fifth of the Adventurers to come to New
     England to remain, and cast in his lot with the Pilgrims at New
     Plimoth&mdash;Martin, Mullens, Collier, and Hatherly preceding him.  A
     wealthy and well-informed man, he became a power in the government.
     Probably Welsh by birth, he was a London merchant when the
     Adventurers were organized.  His home at Marshfield, Massachusetts,
     has since become additionally famous as the home of Daniel Webster.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Thornell (John).  Is sometimes confounded with another Adventurer,
     Matthew Thornhill, as his name is some times so spelled.  There is
     reason to believe they were related.  He was not a friend to the
     Pilgrims.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Thornhill (or Thornell), (Matthew).  Little is known concerning him.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Tilden.  Was of an old family in Kent, &ldquo;a citizen and girdler of London,&rdquo;
      as his will declares, his brother (Nathaniel) later coming to New
     England and settling near Hatherly at Scituate.  Nathaniel&rsquo;s son
     Joseph&mdash;named for his uncle&mdash;was made his executor and heir.  The
     uncle was always a firm friend of the Pilgrims.  Mr. Tilden&rsquo;s will
     is given by Waters (&ldquo;Genealogical Gleanings,&rdquo; vol. i.  p. 71), and
     is of much interest.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Ward.  Appears only as a signer.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
White.  Probably the Rev. John White, a stanch friend of the Pilgrims,
     although not a &ldquo;Separatist,&rdquo; and intimately connected with the
     upbuilding of New England.  His record was a broad and noble one.
     Goodwin says: &ldquo;Haven thinks White was that Dorchester clergyman
     reputed to be the author of the Planters&rsquo; Plea.&rdquo;  Probably, but
     not certainly, William White of the Pilgrims was also an Adventurer.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Wincob (?).  Was a gentleman of the family of the Countess of Lincoln,
     and the one in whose name the first patent in behalf of the
     Adventurers and Pilgrims (which, however, was never used) was taken.
     It is only recently that evidences which, though not conclusive, are
     yet quite indicative, have caused his name to be added to the list,
     though there is still a measure of doubt whether it belongs there.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Weston.  Requires little mention here.  Once a friend of the Pilgrims and
     unmistakably the organizer of the Adventurers, he became a graceless
     ingrate and rascal.  An instrument of good at first, he became a
     heartless and designing enemy of the Planters.  He was a &ldquo;citizen
     and merchant [ironmonger] of London.&rdquo;  It is altogether probable
     that he was originally a tool of Sir Ferdinando Gorges and was led
     by him to influence the Leyden brethren to break off negotiations
     with the Dutch.  He died poor, at Bristol, England.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Wright.  Perhaps came to New Plimoth and married a daughter of the
     MAY-FLOWER Pilgrim, Francis Cooke. If so, he settled at Rehoboth and
     became its leading citizen.  He may possibly have been the settler
     of that name in the Bay-Colony, and the weight of evidence rather
     favors the latter supposition.
</pre>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the Adventurers, Collier, Hatherly, Keayne, Mullens, Revell, Pierce,
      Sharpe, Thomas, and Weston, probably Wright and White, possibly others,
      came to America for longer or shorter periods. Several of them were back
      and forth more than once. The records show that Andrews, Goffe, Pocock,
      Revell, Sharpe, and White were subsequently members of the Massachusetts
      (Winthrop&rsquo;s) Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Arberl finds but six of the Pilgrim Merchant Adventurers who
      later were among the Adventurers with Winthrop&rsquo;s Company of Massachusetts
      Bay, viz.:&mdash;Thomas Andrews, John Pocock, Samuel Sharpe, Thomas Goffe,
      John Revell, John White.
    </p>
    <p>
      He should have added at least, the names of Richard Andrews and Robert
      Keayne, and probably that of Richard Wright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of their number, Collier, Hatherly, Martin, Mullens, Thomas, and
      (possibly) Wright were Plymouth colonists Martin and Mullens, as noted,
      being MAY-FLOWER Pilgrims. Nathaniel Tilden, a brother of Joseph Tilden of
      the Adventurers, came, as previously mentioned, to the Colony from Kent,
      settling at Scituate. Joseph, being apparently unmarried, made his nephew,
      Joseph of Scituate, his residuary legatee, and his property mostly came
      over to the Colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collier, Hatherly, and Thomas all located within a few miles of one
      another, were all wealthy and prominent men in the government of the
      Colony, were intimate friends,&mdash;the first and last especially,&mdash;and
      lent not a little dignity and character to this new dependency of King
      James the First. The remaining twenty or thereabouts whose names are not
      surely known&mdash;though a few of them are pretty safely conjectured,
      some being presumably of the Holland Pilgrims and their friends&mdash;were
      probably chiefly small contributors, whose rights were acquired from time
      to time by others of larger faith in the enterprise, or greater sympathy
      or means. Not all, however, who had ceased to hold their interests when
      the &ldquo;Composition&rdquo; was made with Allerton in behalf of the colonists, in
      1626, were of these small holders. Weston was forced out by stress of
      circumstances; Thomas moved to New England; Pierce was ruined by his
      ventures by sea; Martin and Mullens died in 1621; Pickering and Greene got
      out early, from distrust as to profits; Wincob alone, of this class, was a
      small investor, if he was one at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      By far the greater portion of the sums invested by the Adventurers in
      behalf of the Colony is represented by those whose names are known, those
      still unknown representing, doubtless, numbers rather than amounts. It is,
      however, interesting to note, that more than four sevenths of the original
      number, as given by Captain John Smith, continued to retain their
      interests till the &ldquo;Composition&rdquo; of 1626. It is to be hoped that it may
      yet be possible to increase considerably, if not to perfect, the list of
      these coadjutors of the Pilgrims&mdash;the Merchant Adventurers&mdash;the
      contracting &ldquo;party of the second part,&rdquo; to the charter-party of the
      MAY-FLOWER.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who the Owner of the MAY-FLOWER was, or who his representative, the &ldquo;party
      of the first part,&rdquo; to the charter party of the Pilgrim ship, cannot be
      declared with absolute certainty, though naturally a matter of absorbing
      interest. There is, however, the strongest probability, as before
      intimated, that Thomas Goffe, Esq., one of the Merchant Adventurers, and
      always a stanch friend of the Pilgrims, was the owner of the historic
      vessel,&mdash;and as such has interwoven his name and hers with the
      histories of both the Pilgrim and Puritan hegiras from Old to New England.
      He was, as previously stated, a wealthy &ldquo;merchant and ship owner of
      London,&rdquo; and not only an Adventurer with the Leyden Pilgrims, but&mdash;nearly
      ten years later&mdash;a patentee of the Massachusetts Company and one of
      its charter officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are told in the journal of Governor Winthrop of that Company&mdash;then
      on board the LADY ARBELLA, the, &ldquo;Admiral&rdquo; or flagship of his fleet, riding
      at Cowes, ready to set sail for New England&mdash;that on &ldquo;Easter Monday
      (March 29), 1630, the CHARLES, the MAY-FLOWER, the WILLIAM AND FRANCIS,
      the HOPEWELL, the WHALE, the SUCCESS, and the TRIAL,&rdquo; of his fleet, were
      &ldquo;still at Hampton [Southampton] and are not ready.&rdquo; Of these seven ships
      it is certain that Mr. Goffe owned at least two, as Governor Winthrop&mdash;in
      writing, some days later, of the detention of his son Henry and his friend
      Mr. Pelham, who, going ashore, failed to return to the governor&rsquo;s ship
      before she sailed from Cowes, and so went to the fleet at Southampton for
      passage&mdash;says: &ldquo;So we have left them behind and suppose they will
      come after in one of Mr. Goffe&rsquo;s ships.&rdquo; It is clear, therefore, that Mr.
      Goffe, who was an intimate friend and business associate of Governor
      Winthrop, as the latter&rsquo;s correspondence amply attests, and was a charter
      deputy-governor of the Massachusetts Company, and at this time &ldquo;an
      assistant,&rdquo; was the owner of at least two (probably not more) of these
      seven belated ships of the governor&rsquo;s fleet, riding at Southampton.
      Bearing in mind that the MAY-FLOWER and the WHALE were two of those ships,
      it becomes of much importance to find that these two ships, evidently
      sailing in company (as if of one owner), arrived together in the harbor of
      Charlestown, New England, on Thursday, July 1, having on board one of them
      the governor&rsquo;s missing son, Henry Winthrop. If he came&mdash;as his father
      expected and as appears certain&mdash;&ldquo;in one of Mr. Goffe&rsquo;s ships,&rdquo; then
      evidently, either the MAY-FLOWER or the WHALE, or both, belonged to Mr.
      Goffe. That both were Goffe&rsquo;s is rendered probable by the fact that
      Governor Winthrop&mdash;writing of the vessels as if associated and a
      single interest&mdash;states that &ldquo;most of their cattle [on these ships]
      were dead, whereof a mare and horse of mine.&rdquo; This probability is
      increased, too, by the facts that the ships evidently kept close company
      across the Atlantic (as if under orders of a common owner, and as was the
      custom, for mutual defence and assistance, if occasion required), and that
      Winthrop who, as we above noted, had large dealings with Goffe, seems to
      have practically freighted both these ships for himself and friends, as
      his freight bills attest. They would hence, so far as possible, naturally
      keep together and would discharge their cargoes and have their accountings
      to a single consignee, taken as nearly together as practicable. Both these
      ships came to Charlestown,&mdash;as only one other did,&mdash;and both
      were freighted, as noted, by one party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadly enough, the young man, Henry Winthrop, was drowned at Salem the very
      day after his arrival, and before that of either of the other vessels: the
      HOPEWELL, or WILLIAM AND FRANCIS (which arrived at Salem the 3d); or the
      TRIAL or CHARLES (which arrived&mdash;the first at Charlestown, of the
      last at Salem&mdash;the 5th); or the SUCCESS (which arrived the 6th);
      making it certain that he must have come in either the MAY-FLOWER or the
      WHALE. If, as appears, Goffe owned them both, then his ownership of the
      MAY-FLOWER in 1630 is assured, while all authorities agree without cavil
      that the MAY-FLOWER of Winthrop&rsquo;s fleet in that year (1630) and the
      MAY-FLOWER of the Pilgrims were the same. In the second &ldquo;General Letter of
      Instructions&rdquo; from the Massachusetts Company in England&mdash;dated
      London, May 28, 1629&mdash;to Governor Endicott and his Council, a
      duplicate of which is preserved in the First Book of the Suffolk Registry
      of Deeds at Boston, the historic vessel is described as &ldquo;The MAY-FLOWER,
      of Yarmouth &mdash;William Pierse, Master,&rdquo; and Higginson, in his &ldquo;Journal
      of a Voyage to New England,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;The fifth ship is called the
      MAY-FLOWER carrying passengers and provisions.&rdquo; Yarmouth was hence
      undoubtedly the place of register, and the hailing port of the MAY-FLOWER,&mdash;she
      was very likely built there,&mdash;and this would remain the same, except
      by legal change of register, wherever she was owned, or from what ever
      port she might sail. Weston and Cushman, according to Bradford, found and
      hired her at London, and her probable owner, Thomas Goffe, Esq., was a
      merchant of that city. Dr. Young remarks: &ldquo;The MAYFLOWER Of Higginson&rsquo;s
      fleet is the renowned vessel that brought the Pilgrim Fathers to Plymouth
      in 1620.&rdquo; Hon. James Savage says &ldquo;The MAYFLOWER had been a name of renown
      without forming part of this fleet [Winthrop&rsquo;s, 1630], because in her came
      the devoted planters of Plimouth
      and she had also brought in the year preceding, 1629,
      some of Higginson&rsquo;s company to Salem.&rdquo; Goodwin&rsquo; says: &ldquo;In 1629 she [the
      Pilgrim MAY-FLOWER] came to Salem with a company of the Leyden people for
      Plymouth, and in 1630 was one of the large fleet that attended John
      Winthrop, discharging her passengers at Charlestown.&rdquo; Dr. Young remarks in
      a footnote: &ldquo;Thirty-five of the Leyden congregation with their families
      came over to Plymouth via Salem, in the MAY-FLOWER and TALBOT.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In view of such positive statements as these, from such eminent
      authorities and others, and of the collateral facts as to the probable
      ownership of the MAY-FLOWER in 1630, and on her earlier voyages herein
      presented, the doubt expressed by the Rev. Mr. Blaxland in his &ldquo;Mayflower
      Essays,&rdquo; whether the ship bearing her name was the same, on these three
      several voyages, certainly does not seem justified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain William Pierce, who commanded the MAY-FLOWER in 1629, when she
      brought over part of the Leyden company, was the very early and intimate
      friend of the Pilgrims&mdash;having brought over the ANNE with Leyden
      passengers in 1623&mdash;and sailed exclusively in the employ of the
      Merchant Adventurers, or some of their number, for many years, which is of
      itself suggestive.
    </p>
    <p>
      To accept, as beyond serious doubt, Mr. Goffe&rsquo;s ownership of the
      MAY-FLOWER, when she made her memorable voyage to New Plimoth, one need
      only to compare, and to interpret logically, the significant facts;
      &mdash;that he was a ship-owner of London and one of the body of Merchant
      Adventurers who set her forth on her Pilgrim voyage in 1620; and that he
      stood, as her evident owner, in similar relation to the Puritan company
      which chartered her for New England, similarly carrying colonists,
      self-exiled for religion&rsquo;s sake, in 1629 and again in 1630. This
      conviction is greatly strengthened by the fact that Mr. Goffe continued
      one of the Pilgrim Merchant Adventurers, until their interests were
      transferred to the colonists by the &ldquo;Composition&rdquo; of 1626, and three years
      later (1629) sent by the MAY-FLOWER, on her second New England voyage,
      although under a Puritan charter, another company from the Leyden
      congregation. The (cipher) letter of the &ldquo;Governor and deputies of the
      New-England Company for a plantation in Massachusetts Bay&rdquo; to Captain John
      Endicott, written at Gravesend, England, the 17th of April, 1629, says:
      &ldquo;If you want any Swyne wee have agreed with those of Ne[w] Plimouth that
      they deliver you six Sowes with pigg for which they a[re] to bee allowed 9
      lb. in accompt of what they the Plymouth people owe unto Mr. Goffe [our]
      deputie [Governor].&rdquo; It appears from the foregoing that the Pilgrims at
      New Plymouth were in debt to Mr. Goffe in 1629, presumably for advances
      and passage money on account of the contingent of the Leyden congregation,
      brought over with Higginson&rsquo;s company to Salem, on the second trip of the
      MAY-FLOWER. Mr. Goffe&rsquo;s intimate connection with the Pilgrims was
      certainly unbroken from the organization of their Merchant Adventurers in
      1619/20, through the entire period of ten years, to 1630. There is every
      reason to believe, and none to doubt, that his ownership of the MAY-FLOWER
      of imperishable renown remained equally unbroken throughout these years,
      and that his signature as her owner was appended to her Pilgrim
      charter-party in 1620. Whoever the signatories of her charter-party may
      have been, there can be no doubt that the good ship MAY-FLOWER, in charge
      of her competent, if treacherous, Master, Captain Thomas Jones, and her
      first &ldquo;pilot,&rdquo; John Clarke, lay in the Thames near London through the
      latter part of June and the early part of July, in the summer of 1620,
      undergoing a thorough overhauling, under contract as a colonist-transport,
      for a voyage to the far-off shores of &ldquo;the northern parts of Virginia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In whatever of old English verbiage, with quaint terms and cumbersome
      repetition, the stipulations of this contract of were concealed, there can
      be no doubt that they purported and designed to &ldquo;ingage&rdquo; that &ldquo;the Good
      ship MAY-FLOWER of Yarmouth, of 9 score tuns burthen, whereof for the
      present viage Thomas Joanes is Master,&rdquo; should make the &ldquo;viage&rdquo; as a
      colonist-transport, &ldquo;from the city of London in His Majesty&rsquo;s Kingdom of
      Great Britain,&rdquo; etc., &ldquo;to the neighborhood of the mouth of Hudson&rsquo;s River,
      in the northern parts of Virginia and return, calling at the Port of
      Southampton, outward bound, to complete her lading, the same of all kinds,
      to convey to, and well and safely deliver at, such port or place, at or
      about the mouth of Hudson&rsquo;s River, so-called, in Virginia aforesaid, as
      those in authority of her passengers shall direct,&rdquo; etc., with provision
      as to her return lading, through her supercargo, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is probable that the exact stipulations of the contract will never
      transpire, and we can only roughly guess at them, by somewhat difficult
      comparison with the terms on which the LADY ARBELLA, the &ldquo;Admiral,&rdquo; or
      flagship, of Winthrop&rsquo;s fleet, was chartered in 1630, for substantially
      the like voyage (of course, without expectation or probability, of so long
      a stay on the New England coast), though the latter was much the larger
      ship. The contract probably named an &ldquo;upset&rdquo; or total sum for the &ldquo;round
      voyage,&rdquo; as was the of the case with the LADY ARBELLA, though it is to be
      hoped there was no &ldquo;demurrage&rdquo; clause, exacting damage, as is usual, for
      each day of detention beyond the &ldquo;lay days&rdquo; allowed, for the long and
      unexpected tarries in Cape Cod and Plymouth harbors must have rolled up an
      appalling &ldquo;demurrage&rdquo; claim. Winthrop enters among his memoranda, &ldquo;The
      agreement for the ARBELLA L750, whereof is to be paid in hand [i e. cash
      down] the rest upon certificate of our safe arrival.&rdquo; The sum was
      doubtless considerably in excess of that paid for the MAY-FLOWER, both
      because she was a much larger, heavier-armed, and better-manned ship, of
      finer accommodations, and because ships were, in 1630, in far greater
      demand for the New England trade than in 1620, Winthrop&rsquo;s own fleet
      including no less than ten. The adjustments of freight and passage moneys
      between the Adventurers and colonists are matter of much doubt and
      perplexity, and are not likely to be fully ascertained. The only light
      thrown upon them is by the tariffs for such service on Winthrop&rsquo;s fleet,
      and for passage, etc., on different ships, at a little later day. It is
      altogether probable that transportation of all those accepted as
      colonists, by the agents of the Adventurers and &ldquo;Planters,&rdquo; was without
      direct charge to any individual, but was debited against the whole. But as
      some had better quarters than others, some much more and heavier
      furniture, etc., while some had bulky and heavy goods for their personal
      benefit (such as William Mullen&rsquo;s cases of &ldquo;boots and shoes,&rdquo; etc.), it is
      fair to assume that some schedule of rates for &ldquo;tonnage,&rdquo; if not for
      individuals, became necessary, to prevent complaints and to facilitate
      accounts. Winthrop credits Mr. Goffe&mdash;owner of two of the ships in
      1630&mdash;as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         &ldquo;For ninety-six passengers at L4, L384.
          For thirty-two tons of goods at L3 (per ton).
          For passage for a man, his wife and servant, (3 persons)
          L16/10, L5/10 each.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Goodwin shows the cost of transportation at different times and under
      varying conditions. &ldquo;The expense of securing and shipping Thos. Morton of
      &lsquo;Merry Mount&rsquo; to England, was L12 7 0,&rdquo; but just what proportion the
      passage money bore to the rest of the account, cannot now be told. The
      expense of Mr. Rogers, the young insane clergyman brought over by Isaac
      Allerton, without authority, was, for the voyage out: &ldquo;For passage L1. For
      diet for eleven weeks at 4s. 8d. per week, total L3 11 4&rdquo; [A rather longer
      passage than usual.] Constant Southworth came in the same ship and paid
      the same, L3 11 4, which may hence be assumed as the average charge, at
      that date, for a first-class passage. This does not vary greatly from the
      tariff of to-day, (1900) as, reduced to United States currency, it would
      be about $18; and allowing the value of sterling to be about four times
      this, in purchase ratio, it would mean about $73. The expenses of the
      thirty-five of the Leyden congregation who came over in the MAY-FLOWER in
      1620, and of the others brought in the LION in 1630, were slightly higher
      than these figures, but the cost of the trip from Leyden to England was
      included, with that of some clothing. In 1650, Judge Sewall, who as a
      wealthy man would be likely to indulge in some luxury, gives his outlay
      one way, as, &ldquo;Fare, L2 3 0; cabin expenses, L4 11 4; total, L6 14 4.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE MAY-FLOWER&mdash;THE SHIP HERSELF
    </h3>
    <p>
      Unhappily the early chroniclers familiar with the MAY-FLOWER have left us
      neither representation nor general description of her, and but few data
      from which we may reconstruct her outlines and details for ourselves.
      Tradition chiefly determines her place in one of the few classes into
      which the merchant craft of her day were divided, her tonnage and service
      being almost the only other authentic indices to this class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradford helps us to little more than the statement, that a vessel, which
      could have been no other, &ldquo;was hired at London, being of burden about 9
      score&rdquo; [tons], while the same extraordinary silence, which we have noticed
      as to her name, exists as to her description, with Smith, Bradford,
      Winslow, Morton, and the other contemporaneous or early writers of Pilgrim
      history. Her hundred and eighty tons register indicates in general her
      size, and to some extent her probable model and rig.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long search for a reliable, coetaneous picture of one of the larger ships
      of the merchant service of England, in the Pilgrim period, has been
      rewarded by the discovery of the excellent &ldquo;cut&rdquo; of such a craft, taken
      from M. Blundeville&rsquo;s &ldquo;New and Necessarie Treatise of Navigation,&rdquo;
       published early in the seventeenth century. Appearing in a work of so high
      character, published by so competent a navigator and critic, and
      (approximately) in the very time of the Pilgrim &ldquo;exodus,&rdquo; there can be no
      doubt that it quite correctly, if roughly and insufficiently, depicts the
      outlines, rig, and general cast of a vessel of the MAY-FLOWER type and
      time, as she appeared to those of that day, familiar therewith.

    <p>
      It gives us a ship corresponding, in the chief essentials, to that which
      careful study of the detail and minutiae of the meagre MAY-FLOWER history
      and its collaterals had already permitted the author and others to
      construct mentally, and one which confirms in general the conceptions
      wrought out by the best artists and students who have attempted to portray
      the historic ship herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain J. W. Collins, whose experience and labors in this relation are
      further alluded to, and whose opinion is entitled to respect, writes the
      author in this connection, as follows &ldquo;The cut from Blundeville&rsquo;s
      treatise, which was published more or less contemporaneously with the
      MAYFLOWER, is, in my judgment, misleading, since it doubtless represents a
      ship of an earlier date, and is evidently [sic] reproduced from a
      representation on tapestry, of which examples are still to be seen (with
      similar ships) in England. The actual builder&rsquo;s plans, reproduced by
      Admiral Paris, from drawings still preserved, of ships of the MAYFLOWER&rsquo;S
      time, seem to me to offer more correct and conclusive data for accurately
      determining what the famous ship of the Pilgrim Fathers was like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Decidedly one of the larger and better vessels of the merchant class of
      her day, she presumably followed the prevalent lines of that class, no
      doubt correctly represented, in the main, by the few coeval pictures of
      such craft which have come down to us. No one can state with absolute
      authority, her exact rig, model, or dimensions; but there can be no
      question that all these are very closely determined from even the meagre
      data and the prints we possess, so nearly did the ships of each class
      correspond in their respective features in those days. There is a notable
      similarity in certain points of the MAY-FLOWER, as she has been
      represented by these different artists, which is evidence upon two points:
      first, that all delineators have been obliged to study the type of vessel
      to which she belonged from such representations of it as each could find,
      as neither picture nor description of the vessel herself was to be had;
      and second, that as the result of such independent study nearly all are
      substantially agreed as to what the salient features of her type and class
      were. A model of a ship [3 masts] of the MAY-FLOWER type, and called in
      the Society&rsquo;s catalogue &ldquo;A Model of the MAY FLOWER, after De Bry,&rdquo; but
      itself labelled &ldquo;Model of one of Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s Ships,&rdquo; is
      (mistakenly) exhibited by the Pilgrim Society at Plymouth. It is by no
      means to be taken as a correct representation of the Pilgrim bark. Few of
      the putative pictures of the MAY-FLOWER herself are at all satisfactory,&mdash;apart
      from the environment or relation in which she is usually depicted,&mdash;whether
      considered from an historical, a nautical, or an artistic point of view.
      The only one of these found by the author which has commanded (general, if
      qualified) approval is that entitled &ldquo;The MAY-FLOWER at Sea,&rdquo; a
      reproduction of which, by permission, is the frontispiece of this volume.
      It is from an engraving by the master hand of W. J. Linton, from a drawing
      by Granville Perkins, and appeared in the &ldquo;New England Magazine&rdquo; for
      April, 1898, as it has elsewhere. Its comparative fidelity to fact, and
      its spirited treatment, alike commend it to those familiar with the
      subject, as par excellence the modern artistic picture of the MAY-FLOWER,
      although somewhat fanciful, and its rig, as Captain Collies observes, &ldquo;is
      that of a ship a century later than the MAY-FLOWER; a square topsail on
      the mizzen,&rdquo; he notes, &ldquo;being unknown in the early part of the seventeenth
      century, and a jib on a ship equally rare.&rdquo; Halsall&rsquo;s picture of &ldquo;The
      Arrival of the MAY-FLOWER in Plymouth Harbor,&rdquo; owned by the Pilgrim
      Society, of Plymouth, and hung in the Society&rsquo;s Hall, while presenting
      several historical inaccuracies, undoubtedly more correctly portrays the
      ship herself, in model, rig, etc., than do most of the well-known
      paintings which represent her. It is much to be regretted that the artist,
      in woeful ignorance, or disregard, of the recorded fact that the ship was
      not troubled with either ice or snow on her entrance (at her successful
      second attempt) to Plymouth harbor, should have covered and environed her
      with both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Answering, as the MAY-FLOWER doubtless did, to her type, she was certainly
      of rather &ldquo;blocky,&rdquo; though not unshapely, build, with high poop and
      forecastle, broad of beam, short in the waist, low &ldquo;between decks,&rdquo; and
      modelled far more upon the lines of the great nautical prototype, the
      water-fowl, than the requirements of speed have permitted in the carrying
      trade of more recent years. That she was of the &ldquo;square rig&rdquo; of her time&mdash;when
      apparently no use was made of the &ldquo;fore-and-aft&rdquo; sails which have so
      wholly banished the former from all vessels of her size&mdash;goes without
      saying. She was too large for the lateen rig, so prevalent in the
      Mediterranean, except upon her mizzenmast, where it was no doubt employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief differences which appear in the several &ldquo;counterfeit
      presentments&rdquo; of the historic ship are in the number of her masts and the
      height of her poop and her forecastle. A few make her a brig or &ldquo;snow&rdquo; of
      the oldest pattern, while others depict her as a full-rigged ship,
      sometimes having the auxiliary rig of a small &ldquo;jigger&rdquo; or &ldquo;dandy-mast,&rdquo;
       with square or lateen sail, on peak of stern, or on the bow sprit, or
      both, though usually her mizzenmast is set well aft upon the poop. There
      is no reason for thinking that the former of these auxiliaries existed
      upon the MAY-FLOWER, though quite possible. Her 180 tons measurement
      indicates, by the general rule of the nautical construction of that
      period, a length of from 90 to 100 feet, &ldquo;from taffrail to knighthead,&rdquo;
       with about 24 feet beam, and with such a hull as this, three masts would
      be far more likely than two. The fact that she is always called a &ldquo;ship&rdquo;&mdash;to
      which name, as indicating a class, three masts technically attach&mdash;is
      also somewhat significant, though the term is often generically used. Mrs.
      Jane G. Austin calls the MAY-FLOWER a &ldquo;brig,&rdquo; but there does not appear
      anywhere any warrant for so doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Smithsonian Institution (National Museum) at Washington, D. C.,
      there is exhibited a model of the MAY-FLOWER, constructed from the ratio
      of measurements given in connection with the sketch and working plans of a
      British ship of the merchant MAY-FLOWER class of the seventeenth century,
      as laid down by Admiral Francois Edmond Paris, of France, in his
      &ldquo;Souvenirs de Marine.&rdquo; The hull and rigging of this model were carefully
      worked out by, and under the supervision of Captain Joseph W. Collins
      (long in the service of the Smithsonian Institution, in nautical and
      kindred matters, and now a member of the Massachusetts Commission of
      Inland Fisheries and Game), but were calculated on the erroneous basis of
      a ship of 120 instead of 180 tons measurement. This model, which is upon a
      scale of 1/2 inch to 1 foot, bears a label designating it as &ldquo;The
      &lsquo;MAYFLOWER&rsquo; of the Puritans&rdquo; [sic], and giving the following description
      (written by Captain Collins) of such a vessel as the Pilgrim ship, if of
      120 tons burthen, as figured from such data as that given by Admiral
      Paris, must, approximately, have been. (See photographs of the model
      presented herewith.) &ldquo;A wooden, carvel-built, keel vessel, with full bluff
      bow, strongly raking below water line; raking curved stem; large open
      head; long round (nearly log-shaped) bottom; tumble in top side; short
      run; very large and high square stern; quarter galleries; high forecastle,
      square on forward end, with open rails on each side; open bulwarks to main
      [spar] and quarter-decks; a succession of three quarter-decks or poops,
      the after one being nearly 9 feet above main [spar] deck; two boats stowed
      on deck; ship-rigged, with pole masts [i.e. masts in one piece]; without
      jibs; square sprit sail (or water sail under bowsprit); two square sails
      on fore and main masts, and lateen sail on mizzenmast.&rdquo;

      conformity to which his putative model of the &ldquo;MAY FLOWER&rdquo; was
      constructed, rests, of course, for its correctness, primarily, upon the
      assumptions (which there is no reason to question) that the &ldquo;plates&rdquo; of
      Admiral Paris, his sketches, working plans, dimensions, etc., are
      reliable, and that Captain Collins&rsquo;s mathematics are correct, in reducing
      and applying the Admiral&rsquo;s data to a ship of 120 tons. That there would be
      some considerable variance from the description given, in applying these
      data to a ship of 60 tons greater measurement (i.e. of 180 tons), goes
      without saying, though the changes would appear more largely in the hull
      dimensions than in the rigging. That the description given, and its
      expression in the model depicted, present, with considerable fidelity, a
      ship of the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S class and type, in her day,&mdash;though of sixty
      tons less register, and amenable to changes otherwise,&mdash;is altogether
      probable, and taken together, they afford a fairly accurate idea of the
      general appearance of such a craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to mention of the enlargements which the increased tonnage
      certainly entails, the following features of the description seem to call
      for remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is doubtful whether the vessels of this class had &ldquo;open bulwarks to the
      main [spar] deck,&rdquo; or &ldquo;a succession of three quarter-decks or poops.&rdquo; Many
      models and prints of ships of that period and class show but two. It is
      probable that if the jib was absent, as Captain Collins believes (though
      it was evidently in use upon some of the pinnaces and shallops of the
      time, and its utility therefore appreciated), there was a small squaresail
      on a &ldquo;dandy&rdquo; mast on the bowsprit, and very possibly the &ldquo;sprit&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;water-sail&rdquo; he describes. The length of the vessel as given by Captain
      Collins, as well as her beam, being based on a measurement of but 120
      tons, are both doubtless less than they should be, the depth probably also
      varying slightly, though there would very likely be but few and slight
      departures otherwise from his proximate figures. The long-boat would be
      more likely to be lashed across the hatch amidships than stowed on the
      port side of the deck, unless in use for stowage purposes, as previously
      suggested. Captain Collins very interestingly notes in a letter to the
      author, concerning the measurements indicated by his model: &ldquo;Here we meet
      with a difficulty, even if it is not insurmountable. This is found in the
      discrepancy which exists between the dimensions&mdash;length, breadth, and
      depth&mdash;requisite to produce a certain tonnage, as given by Admiral
      Paris and the British Admiralty. Whether this is due to a difference in
      estimating tonnage between France (or other countries) and Great Britain,
      I am unable to say, but it is a somewhat remarkable fact that the National
      Museum model, which was made for a vessel of 120 tons, as given by Admiral
      Paris who was a Frenchman, has almost exactly the proportions of length,
      depth, and breadth that an English ship of 180 tons would have, if we can
      accept as correct the lists of measurements from the Admiralty records
      published by Charnock . . . In the third volume of Charnock&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of
      Marine Architecture,&rsquo; p. 274., I find that a supply transport of 175 tons,
      built in 1759, and evidently a merchant ship originally, or at least a
      vessel of that class, was 79.4 feet long (tonnage measure), 22.6 feet
      beam, and 11.61 feet deep.&rdquo; The correspondence is noticeable and of much
      interest, but as the writer comments, all depends upon whether or not &ldquo;the
      measurement of the middle of the eighteenth century materially differed in
      Great Britain from what it was in the early part of the previous century.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like all vessels having high stems and sterns, she was unquestionably &ldquo;a
      wet ship,&rdquo;&mdash;upon this voyage especially so, as Bradford shows, from
      being overloaded, and hence lower than usual in the water. Captain John
      Smith says: &ldquo;But being pestered [vexed] nine weeks in this leaking,
      unwholesome ship, lying wet in their cabins; most of them grew very weak
      and weary of the sea.&rdquo; Bradford says, quoting the master of the MAY-FLOWER
      and others: &ldquo;As for the decks and upper works they would caulk them as
      well as they could, . . . though with the working of the ship, they would
      not long keep staunch.&rdquo; She was probably not an old craft, as her captain
      and others declared they &ldquo;knew her to be strong and firm under water;&rdquo; and
      the weakness of her upper works was doubtless due to the strain of her
      overload, in the heavy weather of the autumnal gales. Bradford says: &ldquo;They
      met with many contrary winds and fierce storms with which their ship was
      shrewdly shaken and her upper works made very leaky.&rdquo; That the confidence
      of her master in her soundness below the water-line was well placed, is
      additionally proven by her excellent voyages to America, already noted, in
      1629, and 1630, when she was ten years older.
    </p>
    <p>
      That she was somewhat &ldquo;blocky&rdquo; above water was doubtless true of her, as
      of most of her class; but that she was not unshapely below the water-line
      is quite certain, for the re markable return passage she made to England
      (in ballast) shows that her lower lines must have been good. She made the
      run from Plymouth to London on her return voyage in just thirty-one days,
      a passage that even with the &ldquo;clipper ships&rdquo; of later days would have been
      respectable, and for a vessel of her model and rig was exceptionally good.
      She was &ldquo;light&rdquo; (in ballast), as we know from the correspondence of Weston
      and Bradford, the letter of the former to Governor Carver&mdash;who died
      before it was received&mdash;upbraiding him for sending her home &ldquo;empty.&rdquo;
       The terrible sickness and mortality of the whole company, afloat and
      ashore, had, of course, made it impossible to freight her as intended with
      &ldquo;clapboards&rdquo; [stave-stock], sassafras roots, peltry, etc. No vessels of
      her class of that day were without the high poop and its cabin
      possibilities,&mdash;admirably adapting them to passenger service,&mdash;and
      the larger had the high and roomy topgallant forecastles so necessary for
      their larger crews. The breadth of beam was always considerably greater in
      that day than earlier, or until much later, necessitated by the
      proportionately greater height (&ldquo;topsides&rdquo;), above water, at stem and
      stern. The encroachments of her high poop and forecastle left but short
      waist-room; her waist-ribs limited the height of her &ldquo;between decks;&rdquo;
       while the &ldquo;perked up&rdquo; lines of her bow and stern produced the resemblance
      noted, to the croup and neck of the wild duck. That she was low &ldquo;between
      decks&rdquo; is demonstrated by the fact that it was necessary to &ldquo;cut down&rdquo; the
      Pilgrims&rsquo; shallop&mdash;an open sloop, of certainly not over 30 feet in
      length, some 10 tons burden, and not very high &ldquo;freeboard&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;to stow&rdquo;
       her under the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S spar deck. That she was &ldquo;square-rigged&rdquo;
       follows, as noted, from the fact that it was the only rig in use for ships
      of her class and size, and that she had &ldquo;topsails&rdquo; is shown by the fact
      that the &ldquo;top-saile halliards&rdquo; were pitched over board with John Howland,
      and saved his life. Bradford says: &ldquo;A lustie yonge man (called John
      Howland) coming upon some occasion above ye grattings, was with a seele of
      ye shipe throwne into ye sea: but it pleased God yt he caught hould of ye
      top-saile halliards which hunge over board &amp; rane out at length yet he
      held his hould . . . till he was haled up,&rdquo; etc. Howland had evidently
      just come from below upon the poop-deck (as there would be no &ldquo;grattings&rdquo;
       open in the waist to receive the heavy seas shipped). The ship was clearly
      experiencing &ldquo;heavy weather&rdquo; and a great lurch (&ldquo;seele&rdquo;) which at the
      stern, and on the high, swinging, tilting poop-deck would be most severely
      felt, undoubtedly tossed him over the rail. The topsail halliards were
      probably trailing alongside and saved him, as they have others under like
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not the MAY-FLOWER had the &ldquo;round house&rdquo; under her poop-deck,
      &mdash;-a sort of circular-end deck-house, more especially the quarters,
      by day, of the officers and favored passengers; common, but apparently not
      universal, in vessels of her class,&mdash;we have no positive knowledge,
      but the presumption is that she had, as passenger ships like the PARAGON
      (of only 140 tons), and others of less tonnage, seem to have been so
      fitted!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is plain that, in addition to the larger cabin space and the smaller
      cabins,&mdash;&ldquo;staterooms,&rdquo; nowadays,&mdash;common to ships of the
      MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S size and class, the large number of her passengers, and
      especially of women and children, made it necessary to construct other
      cabins between decks. Whether these were put up at London, or Southampton,
      or after the SPEEDWELL&rsquo;S additional passengers were taken aboard at
      Plymouth, does not appear. The great majority of the men and boys were
      doubtless provided with bunks only, &ldquo;between decks,&rdquo; but it seems that
      John Billington had a cabin there. Bradford narrates of the gunpowder
      escapade of young Francis Billington, that, &ldquo;there being a fowling-piece,
      charged in his father&rsquo;s cabin [though why so inferior a person as
      Billington should have a cabin when there could not have been enough for
      better men, is a query], shot her off in the cabin, there being a little
      barrel of powder half-full scattered in and about the cabin, the fire
      being within four feet of the bed, between the decks, . . . and many
      people gathered about the fire,&rdquo; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever other deductions may be drawn from this very badly constructed
      and ambiguous paragraph of Bradford, two things appear certain,&mdash;one,
      that Billington had a &ldquo;cabin&rdquo; of his own &ldquo;between decks;&rdquo; and the other,
      that there was a &ldquo;fire between decks,&rdquo; which &ldquo;many people&rdquo; were gathered
      &ldquo;about.&rdquo; We can quite forgive the young scamp for the jeopardy in which he
      placed the ship and her company, since it resulted in giving us so much
      data concerning the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S &ldquo;interior.&rdquo; Captain John Smith&rsquo;s remark,
      already quoted, as to the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S people &ldquo;lying wet in their cabins,&rdquo;
       is a hint of much value from an experienced navigator of that time, as to
      the &ldquo;interior&rdquo; construction of ships and the bestowal of passengers in
      them, in that day, doubtless applicable to the MAY-FLOWER.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it was feasible, when lying quietly at anchor in a land-locked
      harbor, with abundance of fire-wood at hand, to have a fire, about which
      they could gather, even if only upon the &ldquo;sand-hearth&rdquo; of the early
      navigators, when upon boisterous seas, in mid-ocean, &ldquo;lying . . . in their
      cabins&rdquo; was the only means of keeping warm possible to voyagers. In &ldquo;Good
      Newes from New England,&rdquo; we find the lines:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                   &ldquo;Close cabins being now prepared,
                    With bred, bief, beire, and fish,
                    The passengers prepare themselves,
                    That they might have their wish.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Her magazine, carpenter&rsquo;s and sailmaker&rsquo;s lockers, etc., were doubtless
      well forward under her forecastle, easily accessible from the spar-deck,
      as was common to merchant vessels of her class and size. Dr. Young, in his
      &ldquo;Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers&rdquo; (p. 86, note), says: &ldquo;This vessel was
      less than the average size of the fishing-smacks that go to the Grand
      Banks. This seems a frail bark in which to cross a stormy ocean of three
      thousand miles in extent. Yet it should be remembered that two of the
      ships of Columbus on his first daring and perilous voyage of discovery,
      were light vessels, without decks, little superior to the small craft that
      ply on our rivers and along our coasts . . . . Frobisher&rsquo;s fleet consisted
      of two barks of twenty-five tons each and a pinnace of ten tons, when he
      sailed in 1576 to discover a north-west passage to the Indies. Sir Francis
      Drake, too, embarked on his voyage for circumnavigating the globe, in
      1577, with five vessels, of which the largest was of one hundred, and the
      smallest fifteen tons. The bark in which Sir Humphrey Gilbert perished was
      of ten tons only.&rdquo; The LITTLE JAMES, which the Company sent to Plymouth in
      July, 1623, was &ldquo;a pinnace of only forty-four tons,&rdquo; and in a vessel of
      fifty tons (the SPEEDWELL), Martin Pring, in 1603, coasted along the
      shores of New England. Goodwin says: &ldquo;In 1587 there were not in all
      England&rsquo;s fleet more than five merchant vessels exceeding two hundred
      tons.&rdquo; The SPARROW-HAWK wrecked on Cape Cod in 1626 was only 40 feet &ldquo;over
      all.&rdquo; The Dutch seem to have built larger vessels. Winthrop records that
      as they came down the Channel, on their way to New England (1630), they
      passed the wreck of &ldquo;a great Dutch merchantman of a thousand tons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S galley, with its primitive conditions for cooking,
      existed rather as a place for the preparation of food and the keeping of
      utensils, than for the use of fire. The arrangements for the latter were
      exceedingly crude, and were limited to the open &ldquo;hearth-box&rdquo; filled with
      sand, the chief cooking appliance being the tripod-kettle of the early
      navigators: This might indeed be set up in any part of the ship where the
      &ldquo;sand-hearth&rdquo; could also go, and the smoke be cared for. It not
      infrequently found space in the fore castle, between decks, and, when fine
      weather prevailed, upon the open deck, as in the open caravels of
      Columbus, a hundred years before. The bake-kettle and the frying-pan held
      only less important places than the kettle for boiling. It must have been
      rather a burst of the imagination that led Mrs. Austin, in &ldquo;Standish of
      Standish,&rdquo; to make Peter Browne remind poor half-frozen Goodman&mdash;whom
      he is urging to make an effort to reach home, when they had been lost, but
      had got in sight of the MAY-FLOWER In the harbor&mdash;of &ldquo;the good fires
      aboard of her.&rdquo; Moreover, on January 22, when Goodman was lost, the
      company had occupied their &ldquo;common-house&rdquo; on shore. Her ordnance doubtless
      comprised several heavy guns (as such were then reckoned), mounted on the
      spar-deck amid ships, with lighter guns astern and on. the rail, and a
      piece of longer range and larger calibre upon the forecastle. Such was the
      general disposal of ordnance upon merchant vessels of her size in that
      day, when an armament was a &lsquo;sine qua non&rsquo;. Governor Winslow in his
      &ldquo;Hypocrisie Unmasked,&rdquo; 1646 (p. 91), says, in writing of the departure of
      the Pilgrims from Delfshaven, upon the SPEEDWELL: &ldquo;The wind being fair we
      gave them a volley of small shot and three pieces of ordnance,&rdquo; by which
      it seems that the SPEEDWELL, of only sixty tons, mounted at least &ldquo;three
      pieces of ordnance&rdquo; as, from the form of expression, there seem to have
      been &ldquo;three pieces,&rdquo; rather than three discharges of the same piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inference is warranted that the MAY-FLOWER, being three times as
      large, would carry a considerably heavier and proportionate armament. The
      LADY ARBELLA, Winthrop&rsquo;s ship, a vessel of 350 tons, carried &ldquo;twenty-eight
      pieces of ordnance;&rdquo; but as &ldquo;Admiral&rdquo; of the fleet, at a time when there
      was a state of war with others, and much piracy, she would presumably
      mount more than a proportionate weight of metal, especially as she
      convoyed smaller and lightly armed vessels, and carried much value. There
      is no reason to suppose that the MAY-FLOWER, in her excessively crowded
      condition, mounted more than eight or ten guns, and these chiefly of small
      calibre. Her boats included her &ldquo;long-boat,&rdquo; with which the experience of
      her company in &ldquo;Cape Cod harbor&rdquo; have made us familiar, and perhaps other
      smaller boats,&mdash;besides the Master&rsquo;s &ldquo;skiff&rdquo; or &ldquo;gig,&rdquo; of whose
      existence and necessity there are numerous proofs. &ldquo;Monday the 27,&rdquo;
       Bradford and Winslow state, &ldquo;it proved rough weather and cross winds, so
      as we were constrained, some in the shallop and others in the long-boat,&rdquo;
       etc. Bradford states, in regard to the repeated springings-a-leak of the
      SPEEDWELL: &ldquo;So the Master of the bigger ship, called Master Jones, being
      consulted with;&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;The Master of the small ship complained his
      ship was so leaky . . . so they [Masters Jones and Reynolds] came to
      consultation, again,&rdquo; etc. It is evident that Jones was obliged to visit
      the SPEEDWELL to inspect her and to consult with the leaders, who were
      aboard her. For this purpose, as for others, a smaller boat than the
      &ldquo;long-boat&rdquo; would often serve, while the number of passengers and crew
      aboard would seem to demand still other boats. Winthrop notices that their
      Captain (Melborne) frequently &ldquo;had his skiff heaved out,&rdquo; in the course of
      their voyage. The Master&rsquo;s small boat, called the &ldquo;skiff&rdquo; or &ldquo;gig,&rdquo; was,
      no doubt, stowed (lashed) in the waist of the ship, while the &ldquo;long-boat&rdquo;
       was probably lashed on deck forward, being hoisted out and in, as the
      practice of those days was, by &ldquo;whips,&rdquo; from the yardarms. It was early
      the habit to keep certain of the live-stock, poultry, rabbits, etc., in
      the unused boats upon deck, and it is possible that in the crowded state
      of the MAY-FLOWER this custom was followed. Bradford remarks that their
      &ldquo;goods or common store . . . were long in unlading [at New Plimoth] for
      want of boats.&rdquo; It seems hardly possible that the Admiralty authorities,&mdash;though
      navigation laws were then few, crude, and poorly enforced,&mdash;or that
      the Adventurers and Pilgrim chiefs themselves, would permit a ship
      carrying some 130 souls to cross the Atlantic in the stormy season,
      without a reasonable boat provision. The capacity of the &ldquo;long-boat&rdquo; we
      know to have been about twenty persons, as nearly that number is shown by
      Bradford and Winslow to have gone in her on the early expeditions from the
      ship, at Cape Cod. She would therefore accommodate only about one sixth of
      the ship&rsquo;s company. As the &ldquo;gig&rdquo; would carry only five or six persons,&mdash;while
      the shallop was stowed between decks and could be of no service in case of
      need upon the voyage,&mdash;the inference is warranted that other boats
      were carried, which fail of specific mention, or that she was wofully
      lacking. The want of boats for unlading, mentioned by Bradford, suggests
      the possibility that some of the ship&rsquo;s quota may have been lost or
      destroyed on her boisterous voyage, though no such event appears of
      record, or is suggested by any one. In the event of wreck, the Pilgrims
      must have trusted, like the Apostle Paul and his associates when cast away
      on the island of Melita, to get to shore, &ldquo;some on boards and some on
      broken pieces of the ship.&rdquo; Her steering-gear, rigging, and the mechanism
      for &ldquo;getting her anchors,&rdquo; &ldquo;slinging,&rdquo; &ldquo;squaring,&rdquo; and &ldquo;cockbilling&rdquo; her
      yards; for &ldquo;making&rdquo; and &ldquo;shortening&rdquo; sail; &ldquo;heaving out&rdquo; her boats and
      &ldquo;handling&rdquo; her cargo, were of course all of the crude and simple patterns
      and construction of the time, usually so well illustrating the ancient
      axiom in physics, that &ldquo;what is lost [spent] in power is gained in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The compass-box and hanging-compass, invented by the English cleric,
      William Barlow, but twelve years before the Pilgrim voyage, was almost the
      only nautical appliance possessed by Captain Jones, of the MAY-FLOWER, in
      which no radical improvement has since been made. Few charts of much value&mdash;especially
      of western waters&mdash;had yet been drafted, but the rough maps and
      diagrams of Cabot, Smith, Gosnold, Pring, Champlain and Dermer, Jones was
      too good a navigator not to have had. In speaking of the landing at Cape
      Cod, the expression is used by Bradford in &ldquo;Mourt&rsquo;s Relation,&rdquo; &ldquo;We went
      round all points of the compass,&rdquo; proving that already the mariner&rsquo;s
      compass had become familiar to the speech even of those not using it
      professionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the ship was &ldquo;well-found&rdquo; in anchors (with solid stocks), hemp
      cables, &ldquo;spare&rdquo; spars, &ldquo;boat-tackling&rdquo; and the heavy &ldquo;hoisting-gear&rdquo; of
      those days, we have the evidence of recorded use. &ldquo;The MAY-FLOWER,&rdquo; writes
      Captain Collins, would have had a hemp cable about 9 inches in
      circumference. Her anchors would probably weigh as follows: sheet anchor
      (or best bower) 500 to 600 lbs.; stream anchor 350 to 400 lbs.; the spare
      anchors same as the stream anchor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charnock&rsquo;s Illustrations&rdquo; show that the anchors used in the MAY-FLOWER
      period were shaped very much like the so called Cape Ann anchor now made
      for our deep-sea fishing vessels. They had the conventional shaped flukes,
      with broad pointed palms, and a long shank, the upper end passing through
      a wooden stock. [Tory shows in his diagrams some of the anchors of that
      period with the space between the shank and flukes nearly filled up in the
      lower part with metal.] Such an anchor has the maximum of holding powers,
      and bearing in mind the elasticity of the hemp cables then used, would
      enable a vessel to ride safely even when exposed to heavy winds and a
      racing sea: There is no doubt, according to the British Admiralty Office,&mdash;which
      should be authority upon the matter, &mdash;that the flag under which the
      MAY-FLOWER, and all other vessels of the merchant marine of Great Britain,
      sailed, at the time she left England (as noted concerning the SPEEDWELL),
      was what became known as the &ldquo;Union Jack,&rdquo; as decreed by James the First,
      in 1606, supplanting the English ensign, which had been the red cross of
      St. George upon a white field. The new flag resulted from the &ldquo;union&rdquo; of
      the crowns and kingdoms of England and Scotland, upon the accession of
      James VI. of Scotland to the English throne, as James I. of England, upon
      the death of queen Elizabeth. Its design was formed by superimposing the
      red cross of St. George upon the white cross of St. Andrew, on a dark blue
      field; in other words, by imposing the cross of St. George, taken from the
      English ensign, upon the Scotch flag, and creating there by the new flag
      of Great Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a little monograph on &ldquo;The British Flag&mdash;Its Origin and History,&rdquo;
       a paper read by its author, Jona. F. Morris, Esq., before the Connecticut
      Historical Society, June 7, 1881, and reprinted at Hartford (1889), Mr.
      Morris, who has made much study of the matter, states (p. 4): &ldquo;In 1603,
      James VI. of Scotland was crowned James I. of England. The Scots, in their
      pride that they had given a king to England, soon began to contend that
      the cross of St. Andrew should take precedence of the cross of St. George,
      that ships bearing the flag of the latter should salute that of St.
      Andrew. To allay the contention, the King, on the 12th of April, 1606,
      ordered that all subjects of Great Britain travelling by sea shall bear at
      the maintop the red cross of St. George and the white cross, commonly
      called the cross of St. Andrew, joined together according to a form made
      by his heralds besides this all vessels belonging to South Britain or
      England might wear the cross of St. George at the peak or fore, as they
      were wont, and all vessels belonging to North Britain or Scotland might
      wear the cross of St. Andrew at the fore top, as they had been accustomed;
      and all vessels were for bidden to wear any other flag at their peril. The
      new flag thus designed by the heralds and proclaimed by this order was
      called the &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Colors.&rsquo; For a long period the red cross had been the
      colors of English navigators, as well as the badge of English soldiery . .
      . . No permanent English settlement in America was made until after the
      adoption of the &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Colors.&rsquo; Jamestown, Plymouth, Salem, and Boston
      were settled under the new flag, though the ships bringing over settlers,
      being English vessels, also carried the red cross as permitted.&rdquo; Mr.
      Barlow Cumberland, of Toronto, Canada, has also given, in a little
      monograph entitled &ldquo;The Union Jack&rdquo; (published by William Briggs of that
      city, 1898), an admirable account of the history of the British jack,
      which confirms the foregoing conclusions. The early English jack was later
      restored. Such, roughly sketched, was the Pilgrim ship, the renowned
      MAY-FLOWER, as, drafted from the meagre but fairly trustworthy and
      suggestive data available, she appears to us of to-day.

      <big> HER HISTORY: </big>
    </p>
    <p>
      In even the little we know of the later history of the ship, one cannot
      always be quite sure of her identity in the records of vessels of her
      name, of which there have been many. Dr. Nathaniel B. Shurtleff, of
      Boston, says that &ldquo;a vessel bearing this name was owned in England about
      fifteen years or more before the voyage of our forefathers, but it would
      be impossible to prove or disprove its identity with the renowned
      MAY-FLOWER, however great such a probability might be. It is known,
      nevertheless, that&mdash;the identical famous vessel afterwards hailed
      from various English ports, such as London, Yarmouth, and Southampton, and
      that it was much used in transporting immigrants to this country. What
      eventually became of it and what was the end of its career, are equally
      unknown to history.&rdquo; Goodwin says: &ldquo;It does not appear that the MAY-FLOWER
      ever revisited Plymouth, but in 1629 she came to Salem,&rdquo; with a company of
      the Leyden people for Plymouth, under command of Captain William Peirce,
      the warm friend of the Pilgrims, and in 1630 was one of the large fleet
      that attended John Winthrop, under a different master, discharging her
      passengers at Charlestown. Nothing is certainly known of her after that
      time. In 1648 a ship [hereinafter mentioned by Hunter] named the
      MAY-FLOWER was engaged in the slave trade, and the ill-informed as well as
      the ill-disposed have sometimes sneeringly alleged that this was our
      historic ship; but it is ascertained that the slaver was a vessel of three
      hundred and fifty tons,&mdash;nearly twice the size of our ship of happy
      memory. In 1588 the officials of Lynn (England) offered the &ldquo;MAY-FLOWER&rdquo;
       (150 tons) to join the fleet against the dreaded Spanish Armada. In 1657,
      Samuel Vassall, of London, complained that the government had twice
      impressed his ship, MAY-FLOWER, which he had &ldquo;fitted out with sixty men,
      for the Straits.&rdquo; Rev. Joseph Hunter, author of &ldquo;The Founders of New
      Plymouth,&rdquo; one of the most eminent antiquarians in England, and an
      indefatigable student of Pilgrim history among British archives, says: &ldquo;I
      have not observed the name of MAY FLOWER [in which style he always writes
      it] before the year 1583 . . . But the name soon became exceedingly
      popular among those to whom belonged the giving of the names to vessels in
      the merchant-service. Before the close of that century [the sixteenth] we
      have a MAY-FLOWER of Hastings; a MAY-FLOWER of Rie; a MAY-FLOWER of
      Newcastle: a MAY FLOWER of Lynn; and a MAY-FLOWER Of Yarmouth: both in
      1589. Also a MAY-FLOWER of Hull, 1599; a MAY FLOWER of London of eighty
      tons burden, 1587, and 1594, Of which Richard Ireland was the master, and
      another MAY-FLOWER of the same port, of ninety tons burthen, of which
      Robert White was the master in 1594, and a third MAY-FLOWER of London,
      unless it is the same vessel with one of the two just spoken of, only with
      a different master, William Morecock. In 1587 there was a MAY-FLOWER Of
      Dover, of which John Tooke was the master. In 1593 there was a MAY-FLOWER
      of Yarmouth of 120 tons, of which William Musgrove was the master. In 1608
      there was a MAY-FLOWER of Dartmouth, of which Nicholas Waterdonne was the
      master; and in 1609 a MAY-FLOWER of Middleburgh entered an English port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later in the century we find a MAY-FLOWER of Ipswich, and another of
      Newcastle in 1618; a MAY-FLOWER of York in 1621; a MAY-FLOWER of
      Scarborough in 1630, Robert Hadock the master; a MAY-FLOWER of Sandwich
      the same year, John Oliver the master; a MAY-FLOWER of Dover, 1633, Walter
      Finnis, master, in which two sons of the Earl of Berkshire crossed to
      Calais. &ldquo;Which of these was the vessell which carried over the precious
      [Pilgrim] freight cannot perhaps be told [apparently neither, unless
      perhaps the MAY-FLOWER of Yarmouth of 1593, in which case her tonnage is
      incorrectly given], but we learn from Mr. Sherley&rsquo;s letter to Governor
      Bradford&rsquo; that the same vessel was employed in 1629 in passing between the
      two countries, a company of the church at Leyden, who had joined in the
      first emigration, intending to pass in it to America; and in the same
      author we find that the vessel arrived in the harbour of Charlestown [N.
      E.] on July 1, 1630. There was a MAY-FLOWER which, in 1648, gained an
      unenviable notoriety as a slaver. But this was not the MAY-FLOWER which
      had carried over the first settlers, it being a vessel Of 350 tons, while
      the genuine MAY-FLOWER was of only 180 tons.&rdquo; Of the first of her two
      known visits, after her voyage with the Pilgrim company from Leyden,
      Goodwin says: &ldquo;In August, 1629, the renowned MAY-FLOWER came from England
      to Salem under Plymouth&rsquo;s old friend [William] Peirce, and in her came
      thirty-five Leyden people, on their way to Plymouth.&rdquo; The number has been
      in dispute, but the large cost of bringing them, over L500, would suggest
      that their families must have also come, as has been alleged, but for the
      following from Governor Bradford&rsquo;s Letter Book: &ldquo;These persons,&rdquo; he says,
      &ldquo;were in all thirty-five, which came at this time unto us from Leyden,
      whose charge out of Holland into England, and in England till the ship was
      ready, and then their transportation hither, came to a great deal of
      money, for besides victuals and other expenses, they were all newly
      apparelled.&rdquo; Shirley, one of the Adventurers, writing to Governor Bradford
      in 1629, says: &ldquo;Here are now many of your friends from Leyden coming over.
      With them also we have sent some servants, or in the ship that went lately
      (I think called the TALBOT), and this that these come in is the
      MAY-FLOWER.&rdquo; All that Higginson&rsquo;s journal tells of her, as noted, is, that
      &ldquo;she was of Yarmouth;&rdquo; was commanded by William Peirce, and carried
      provisions and passengers, but the fact that she was under command of
      Captain Peirce of itself tells much. On her next trip the MAY-FLOWER
      sailed from Southampton, in May, 1630, as part of Winthrop&rsquo;s fleet, and
      arrived at Charlestown July 1. She was, on this voyage, under command of a
      new master (perhaps a Captain Weatherby), Captain Peirce having, at this
      time, command of the ship LYON, apparently in the service of Plymouth
      Colony. A vessel of this name [MAY-FLOWER] was sailing between England and
      Boston in 1656. Young says: &ldquo;The MAY-FLOWER is a ship of renown in the
      history of the colonization of New England. She was one of the five
      vessels which, in 1629, conveyed Higginson&rsquo;s company to Salem, and also
      one of the fleet which, in 1630, brought over his colony to Massachusetts
      Bay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      October 6, 1652, &ldquo;Thomas Webber, Mr. of the good shipp called the
      MAYFLOWER of the burden of Two hundred Tuns or there abouts . . . .
      Rideing at Ancor in the Harber of Boston,&rdquo; sold one-sixteenth of the ship
      &ldquo;for good &amp; valluable Consideracons to Mr. John Pinchon of Springfield
      Mrchant.&rdquo; The next day, October 7, 1652, the same &ldquo;Thomas Webber, Mr, of
      the good Shipp called the MAY FLOWER of Boston in New England now bound
      for the barbadoes and thence to London,&rdquo; acknowledges an indebtedness to
      Theodore Atkinson, a wealthy &ldquo;hatter, felt-maker,&rdquo; and merchant of Boston,
      and the same day (October 7, 1652), the said &ldquo;Thomas Webber, Mr. of the
      good shipp called the MAY FLOWER of the burthen of Two hundred tuns or
      thereabouts,&rdquo; sold &ldquo;unto Theodore Atkinson felt-maker one-sixteenth part
      as well of said Shipp as of all &amp; singular her masts Sails Sail-yards
      Ancors Cables Ropes Cords Gunns Gunpowder Shott Artillery Tackle Munition
      apparrell boate skiffe and furniture to the same belonging.&rdquo; It is of
      course possible that this was the historic ship, though, if so,
      reappearing twenty two years after her last known voyage to New England.
      If the same, she was apparently under both new master and owner. From the
      facts that she is called &ldquo;of Boston in New England&rdquo; and was trading
      between that port, &ldquo;the Barbadoes&rdquo; and London, it is not impossible that
      she may have been built at Boston&mdash;a sort of namesake descendant of
      the historic ship&mdash;and was that MAY-FLOWER mentioned as belonging, in
      1657, to Mr. Samuel Vassall; as he had large interests alike in Boston,
      Barbadoes, and London. Masters of vessels were often empowered to sell
      their ships or shares in them. Although we know not where her keel was
      laid, by what master she was built, or where she laid her timbers when her
      work was done, by virtue of her grand service to humanity, her fame is
      secure, and her name written among the few, the immortal names that were
      not born to die.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE OFFICERS AND CREW OF THE MAYFLOWER
    </h3>
    <p>
      The officers and crew of the MAY-FLOWER were obviously important factors
      in the success of the Pilgrim undertaking, and it is of interest to know
      what we may concerning them. We have seen that the &ldquo;pilot,&rdquo; John Clarke,
      was employed by Weston and Cushman, even before the vessel upon which he
      was to serve had been found, and he had hence the distinction of being the
      first man &ldquo;shipped&rdquo; of the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S complement. It is evident that he
      was promptly hired on its being known that he had recently returned from a
      voyage to Virginia in the cattle-ship FALCON, as certain to be of value in
      the colonists&rsquo; undertakings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing that the Adventurers&rsquo; agents were seeking both a ship and a master
      for her, it was the natural thing for the latter, that he should propose
      the Captain under whom he had last sailed, on much the same voyage as that
      now contemplated. It is an interesting fact that something of the
      uncertainty which for a time existed as to the names and features of the
      Pilgrim barks attaches the names and identity of their respective
      commanders. The &ldquo;given&rdquo; name of &ldquo;Master&rdquo; Reynolds, &ldquo;pilott&rdquo; and &ldquo;Master&rdquo;
       of the SPEED WELL, does not appear, but the assertion of Professor Arber,
      though positive enough, that &ldquo;the Christian name of the Captain of the
      MAY-FLOWER is not known,&rdquo; is not accepted by other authorities in Pilgrim
      history, though it is true that it does not find mention in the
      contemporaneous accounts of the Pilgrim ship and her voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no room for doubt that the Captain of the FALCON&mdash;whose
      release from arrest while under charge of piracy the Earl of Warwick
      procured, that he might take command of the above-named cattle-ship on her
      voyage to Virginia, as hereinafter shown&mdash;was Thomas Jones. The
      identity of this man and &ldquo;Master Jones&rdquo; who assumed command of the
      MAY-FLOWER&mdash;with the former mate of the FALCON, John Clarke, as his
      first officer&mdash;is abundantly certified by circumstantial evidence of
      the strongest kind, as is also the fact that he commanded the ship
      DISCOVERY a little later.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the powerful backing of such interested friends as the Earl of
      Warwick and Sir Ferdinando Gorges, undoubtedly already in league with
      Thomas Weston, who probably made the contract with Jones, as he had with
      Clarke, the suggestion of the latter as to the competency and availability
      of his late commander would be sure of prompt approval, and thus, in all
      probability, Captain Thomas Jones, who finds his chief place in history&mdash;and
      a most important one&mdash;as Master of the MAY-FLOWER, came to that
      service.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1619, as appears by Neill, the Virginia Company had one John Clarke in
      Ireland, &ldquo;buying cattle for Virginia.&rdquo; We know that Captain Jones soon
      sailed for Virginia with cattle, in the FALCON, of 150 tons, and as this
      was the only cattle ship in a long period, we can very certainly identify
      Clarke as the newly-hired mate of the MAY-FLOWER, who, Cush man says
      (letter of June 11/21, 1620), &ldquo;went last year to Virginia with a ship of
      kine.&rdquo; As 1620 did not begin until March 25, a ship sailing in February
      would have gone out in 1619, and Jones and Clarke could easily have made
      the voyage in time to engage for the MAY-FLOWER in the following June.
      &ldquo;Six months after Jones&rsquo;s trip in the latter&rdquo; (i.e. after his return from
      the Pilgrim voyage), Neill says, &ldquo;he took the DISCOVERY (60 tons) to
      Virginia, and then northward, trading along the coast. The Council for New
      England complained of him to the Virginia Company for robbing the natives
      on this voyage. He stopped at Plymouth (1622), and, taking advantage of
      the distress for food he found there, was extortionate in his prices. In
      July, 1625, he appeared at Jamestown, Virginia, in possession of a Spanish
      frigate, which he said had been captured by one Powell, under a Dutch
      commission, but it was thought a resumption of his old buccaneering
      practices. Before investigation he sickened and died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That Jones was a man of large experience, and fully competent in his
      profession, is beyond dispute. His disposition, character, and deeds have
      been the subject of much discussion. By most writers he is held to have
      been a man of coarse, &ldquo;unsympathetic&rdquo; nature, &ldquo;a rough sea-dog,&rdquo; capable
      of good feeling and kindly impulses at times, but neither governed by them
      nor by principle. That he was a &ldquo;highwayman of the seas,&rdquo; a buccaneer and
      pirate, guilty of blood for gold, there can be no doubt. Certainly nothing
      could justify the estimate of him given by Professor Arber, that &ldquo;he was
      both fair-minded and friendly toward the Pilgrim Fathers,&rdquo; and he
      certainly stands alone among writers of reputation in that opinion.
      Jones&rsquo;s selfishness,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Bradford himself&mdash;whose authority in the matter will not be
     doubted&mdash;says (Historie, Mass. ed.  p. 112): &ldquo;As this calamitie,
     the general sickness, fell among ye passengers that were to be left
     here to plant, and were basted ashore and made to drinke water, that
     the sea-men might have ye more bear [beer] and one in his sickness
     desiring but a small can of beare it was answered that if he were
     their own father he should have none.&rdquo;  Bradford also shows (op.
     cit.  p. 153) the rapacity of Jones, when in command of the
     DISCOVERY, in his extortionate demands upon the Plymouth planters,
     notwithstanding their necessities.]
</pre>
    <p>
      <br /> threats, boorishness, and extortion, to say nothing of his
      exceedingly bad record as a pirate, both in East and West Indian waters,
      compel a far different estimate of him as a man, from that of Arber,
      however excellent he was as a mariner. Professor Arber dissents from
      Goodwin&rsquo;s conclusion that Captain Jones of the DISCOVERY was the former
      Master of the MAY-FLOWER, but the reasons of his dissent are by no means
      convincing. He argues that Jones would not have accepted the command of a
      vessel so much smaller than his last, the DISCOVERY being only one third
      the size of the MAY-FLOWER. Master-mariners, particularly when just
      returned from long and unsuccessful voyages, especially if in bad repute,&mdash;as
      was Jones, &mdash;are obliged to take such employment as offers, and are
      often glad to get a ship much smaller than their last, rather than remain
      idle. Moreover, in Jones&rsquo;s case, if, as appears, he was inclined to
      buccaneering, the smaller ship would serve his purpose&mdash;as it seems
      it did satisfactorily. Nor is the fact that Bradford speaks of him&mdash;although
      previously so well acquainted&mdash;as &ldquo;one Captain Jones,&rdquo; to be taken as
      evidence, as Arber thinks, that the Master of the DISCOVERY was some other
      of the name. Bradford was writing history, and his thought just then was
      the especial Providence of God in the timely relief afforded their
      necessities by the arrival of the ships with food, without regard to the
      individuals who brought it, or the fact that one was an acquaintance of
      former years. On the other hand, Winslow&mdash;in his &ldquo;Good Newes from New
      England&rdquo; &mdash;records the arrival of the two ships in August, 1622, and
      says, &ldquo;the one as I take [recollect] it, was called the DISCOVERY, Captain
      Jones having command thereof,&rdquo; which on the same line of argument as
      Arber&rsquo;s might be read, &ldquo;our old acquaintance Captain Jones, you know&rdquo;! If
      the expression of Bradford makes against its being Captain Jones, formerly
      of the MAY-FLOWER, Winslow&rsquo;s certainly makes quite as much for it, while
      the fact which Winslow recites, viz. that the DISCOVERY, under Jones, was
      sailing as consort to the SPARROW, a ship of Thomas Weston,&mdash;who
      employed him for the MAY-FLOWER, was linked with him in the Gorges
      conspiracy, and had become nearly as degenerate as he,&mdash;is certainly
      significant. There are still better grounds, as will appear in the closely
      connected relations of Jones, for holding with Goodwin rather than with
      Arber in the matter. The standard authority in the case is the late Rev.
      E. D. Neill, D. D., for some years United States consul at Dublin, who
      made very considerable research into all matters pertaining to the
      Virginia Companies, consulting their original records and &ldquo;transactions,&rdquo;
       the Dutch related documents, the &ldquo;Calendars of the East India Company,&rdquo;
       etc. Upon him and his exhaustive work all others have largely drawn,&mdash;notably
      Professor Arber himself,&mdash;and his conclusions seem entitled to the
      same weight here which Arber gives them in other relations. Dr. Neill is
      clearly of opinion that the Captains of the MAY-FLOWER and the DISCOVERY
      were identical, and this belief is shared by such authorities in Pilgrim
      literature as Young, Prince, Goodwin, and Davis, and against this
      formidable consensus of opinion, Arber, unless better supported, can
      hardly hope to prevail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of Jones&rsquo;s duplicity and fraud, in bringing the Pilgrims to
      land at Cape Cod instead of the &ldquo;neighbor-hood of Hudson&rsquo;s River,&rdquo; has
      been much mooted and with much diversity of opinion, but in the light of
      the subjoined evidence and considerations it seems well-nigh impossible to
      acquit him of the crime&mdash;for such it was, in inception, nature, and
      results, however overruled for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      The specific statements of Bradford and others leave no room for doubt
      that the MAY-FLOWER Pilgrims fully intended to make their settlement
      somewhere in the region of the mouth of &ldquo;Hudson&rsquo;s River.&rdquo; Morton states in
      terms that Captain Jones&rsquo;s &ldquo;engagement was to Hudson&rsquo;s River.&rdquo; Presumably,
      as heretofore noted, the stipulation of his charter party required that he
      should complete his outward voyage in that general locality. The northern
      limits of the patents granted in the Pilgrim interest, whether that of
      John Wincob (or Wincop) sealed June 9/ 19, 1619, but never used, or the
      first one to John Pierce, of February 2/12, 1620, were, of course, brought
      within the limits of the First (London) Virginia Company&rsquo;s charter, which
      embraced, as is well-known, the territory between the parallels of 34 deg.
      and 41 deg. N. latitude. The most northerly of these parallels runs but
      about twenty miles to the north of the mouth of &ldquo;Hudson&rsquo;s River.&rdquo; It is
      certain that the Pilgrims, after the great expense, labor, and pains of
      three years, to secure the protection of these Patents, would not
      willingly or deliberately, have planted themselves outside that
      protection, upon territory where they had none, and where, as interlopers,
      they might reasonably expect trouble with the lawful proprietors. Nor was
      there any reason why, if they so desired, they should not have gone to
      &ldquo;Hudson&rsquo;s River&rdquo; or its vicinity, unless it was that they had once seemed
      to recognize the States General of Holland as the rightful owners of that
      territory, by making petition to them, through the New Netherland Company,
      for their authority and protection in settling there. But even this fact
      constituted no moral or legal bar to such action, if desirable First,
      because it appears certain that, whatever the cause, they &ldquo;broke off&rdquo;
       themselves their negotiations with the Dutch,&mdash;whether on account of
      the inducements offered by Thomas Weston, or a doubt of the ability of the
      Dutch to maintain their claim to that region, and to protect there, or
      both, neither appears nor matters. Second, because the States General&mdash;whether
      with knowledge that they of Leyden had so &ldquo;broken off&rdquo; or from their own
      doubts of their ability to maintain their claim on the Hudson region, does
      not appear&mdash;rejected the petition made to them in the Pilgrims&rsquo;
      behalf. It is probable that the latter was the real reason, from the fact
      that the petition was twice rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      In view of the high opinion of the Leyden brethren, entertained, as we
      know, by the Dutch, it is clear that the latter would have been pleased to
      secure them as colonists; while if at all confident of their rights to the
      territory, they must have been anxious to colonize it and thus confirm
      their hold, increase their revenues as speedily as possible, and
    </p>
    <p>
      Third, because it appears upon the showing of the petition itself, made by
      the New Netherland Company (to which the Leyden leaders had looked,
      doubtless on account of its pretensions, for the authority and protection
      of the States General, as they afterward did to the English Virginia
      Company for British protection), that this Company had lost its own
      charter by expiration, and hence had absolutely nothing to offer the
      Leyden people beyond the personal and associate influence of its members,
      and the prestige of a name that had once been potential. In fact, the New
      Netherland Company was using the Leyden congregation as a leverage to pry
      for itself from the States General new advantages, larger than it had
      previously enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover it appears by the evidence of both the petition of the Directors
      of the New Netherland Company to the Prince of Orange (February 2/12,

      charter had expired. There can be no doubt that the Leyden leaders knew,
      from their dealings with the New Netherland Company, and the study of the
      whole problem which they evidently made, that this region was open to them
      or any other parties for habitation and trade, so far as any prior grants

      To Englishmen, the English claim to the territory at &ldquo;Hudson&rsquo;s River&rdquo; was
      valid, by virtue of the discovery of the Cabots, under the law of nations
      as then recognized, not withstanding Hudson&rsquo;s more particular explorations
      of those parts in 1609, in the service of Holland, especially as no colony
      or permanent occupancy of the region by the Dutch had been made.

      of Elizabeth had come to a life-and-death grapple with Spain, and not
      until the discovery of America had advanced much nearer completion, so
      that its value began to be more correctly understood, that political and
      commercial motives combined in determining England to attack Spain through
      America, and to deprive her of supremacy in the colonial and maritime
      world. Then the voyages of the Cabots assumed an importance entirely new,
      and could be quoted as the basis of a prior claim on the part of the
      English Crown, to lands which it [through the Cabots] had discovered.&rdquo;

      <br /> the Pilgrims recognized the need of a strong power behind them,
      under whose aegis they might safely plant, and by virtue of whose might
      and right they could hope to keep their lives and possessions. The King of
      England had, in 1606, granted charters to the two Virginia Companies,
      covering all the territory in dispute, and, there could be no doubt, would
      protect these grants and British proprietorship therein, against all
      comers. Indeed, the King (James I.) by letter to Sir Dudley Carleton, his
      ambassador at the Hague, under date of December 15, 1621, expressly
      claimed his rights in the New Netherland territory and instructed him to
      impress upon the government of the States General his Majesty&rsquo;s claim,&mdash;&ldquo;who,
      &lsquo;jure prime occupation&rsquo; hath good and sufficient title to these parts.&rdquo;
       There can be no question that the overtures of Sandys, Weston, and others
      to make interest for them with one of these English Companies, agreed as
      well with both the preferences and convictions of the Leyden Pilgrims, as
      they did with the hopes and designs of Sir Ferdinando Gorges. In the light
      of these facts, there appears to have been neither legal nor moral bar to
      the evident intention of the Pilgrims to settle in the vicinity of
      &ldquo;Hudson&rsquo;s River,&rdquo; if they so elected. In their light, also, despite the
      positive allegations of the truthful but not always reliable Morton, his
      charges of intrigue between the Dutch and Master Jones of the MAY-FLOWER,
      to prevent the settlement of his ship&rsquo;s company at &ldquo;Hudson&rsquo;s River,&rdquo; may
      well be doubted. Writing in &ldquo;New England&rsquo;s Memorial&rdquo; in 1669, Morton says:
      &ldquo;But some of the Dutch, having notice of their intentions, and having
      thoughts about the same time of erecting a plantation there likewise, they
      fraudulently hired the said Jones, by delays while they were in England,
      and now under pretence of the shoals the dangers of the Monomoy Shoals off
      Cape Cod to disappoint them in going thither.&rdquo; He adds: &ldquo;Of this plot
      between the Dutch and Mr. Jones, I have had late and certain
      intelligence.&rdquo; If this intelligence was more reliable than his assertion
      concerning the responsibility of Jones for the &ldquo;delays while they were in
      England,&rdquo; it may well be discredited, as not the faintest evidence appears
      to make him responsible for those delays, and they are amply accounted for
      without him. Without questioning the veracity of Morton (while suggesting
      his many known errors, and that the lapse of time made it easy to
      misinterpret even apparently certain facts), it must be remembered that he
      is the original sponsor for the charge of Dutch intrigue with Jones, and
      was its sole support for many years. All other writers who have accepted
      and indorsed his views are of later date, and but follow him, while
      Bradford and Winslow, who were victims of this Dutch conspiracy against
      them, if it ever existed, were entirely silent in their writings upon the
      matter, which we may be sure they would not have been, had they suspected
      the Dutch as prime movers in the treachery. That there was a conspiracy to
      accomplish the landing of the MAY-FLOWER planters at a point north of &ldquo;the
      Hudson&rdquo; (in fact, north of the bounds defined by the (first) Pierce
      patent, upon which they relied), i.e. north of 41 deg. N. latitude,&mdash;is
      very certain; but that it was of Dutch origin, or based upon motives which
      are attributed to the Dutch, is clearly erroneous. While the historical
      facts indicate an utter lack of motive for such an intrigue on the part of
      the Dutch, either as a government or as individuals, there was no lack of
      motive on the part of certain others, who, we can but believe, were
      responsible for the conspiracy. Moreover, the chief conspirators were
      such, that, even if the plot was ultimately suspected by the Pilgrims, a
      wise policy&mdash;indeed, self-preservation &mdash;would have dictated
      their silence. That the Dutch were without sufficient motive or interest
      has been declared. That the States General could have had no wish to
      reject so exceptionally excellent a body of colonists as subjects, and as
      tenants to hold and develop their disputed territory&mdash;if in position
      to receive them and guarantee them protection &mdash;is clear. The sole
      objection that could be urged against them was their English birth, and
      with English regiments garrisoning the Dutch home cities, and foreigners
      of every nation in the States General&rsquo;s employ, by land and by sea, such
      an objection could have had no weight. Indeed, the Leyden party proposed,
      if they effected satisfactory arrangements with the States General (as
      stated by the Directors of the New Netherland Company), &ldquo;to plant there
      [at &ldquo;Hudson&rsquo;s River&rdquo;] a new commonwealth, all under the order and command
      of your Princely Excellency and their High Mightinesses the States
      General:&rdquo; The Leyden Pilgrims were men who kept their agreements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dutch trading-companies, who were the only parties in the Low
      Countries who could possibly have had any motive for such a conspiracy,
      were at this time themselves without charters, and the overtures of the
      principal company, made to the government in behalf of themselves and the
      Leyden brethren, had recently, as we have seen, been twice rejected. They
      had apparently, therefore, little to hope for in the near future;
      certainly not enough to warrant expenditure and the risk of disgraceful
      exposure, in negotiations with a stranger&mdash;an obscure ship-master&mdash;to
      change his course and land his passengers in violation of the terms of his
      charter-party;&mdash;negotiations, moreover, in which neither of the
      parties could well have had any guaranty of the other&rsquo;s good faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as previously asserted, there was a party&mdash;to whom such knavery
      was an ordinary affair&mdash;who had ample motive, and of whom Master
      Thomas Jones was already the very willing and subservient ally and tool,
      and had been such for years. Singularly enough, the motive governing this
      party was exactly the reverse of that attributed&mdash;though illogically
      and without reason&mdash;to the Dutch. In the case of the latter, the
      alleged animus was a desire to keep the Pilgrim planters away from their
      &ldquo;Hudson&rsquo;s River&rdquo; domain. In the case of the real conspirators, the purpose
      was to secure these planters as colonists for, and bring them to, the more
      northern territory owned by them. It is well known that Sir Ferdinando
      Gorges was the leading spirit of the &ldquo;Second Virginia Company,&rdquo; as he also
      became (with the Earl of Warwick a close second) of &ldquo;The Council for the
      Affairs of New England,&rdquo; of which both men were made &ldquo;Governors,&rdquo; in
      November of 1620, when the Council practically superseded the &ldquo;Second
      Virginia Company.&rdquo; The Great Charter for &ldquo;The Council of Affairs of New
      England,&rdquo; commonly known as &ldquo;The Council for New England,&rdquo; issued Tuesday,
      November 3/13, 1620, and it held in force till Sunday, June 7/17, 1635.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although not its official head, and ranked at its board by dukes and
      earls, Sir Ferdinando Gorges was&mdash;as he had been in the old Plymouth
      (or Second) Virginia Company&mdash;the leading man. This was largely from
      his superior acquaintance with, and long and varied experience in, New
      England affairs. The &ldquo;Council&rdquo; was composed of forty patentees, and Baxter
      truly states, that &ldquo;Sir Ferdinando Gorges, at this time [1621] stood at the head of the Council for New England, so far as influence went; in fact, his hand
      shaped its affairs.&rdquo; This company, holding&mdash;by the division of
      territory made under the original charter-grants&mdash;a strip of
      territory one hundred miles wide, on the North American coast, between the
      parallels of 41 deg. and 45 deg. N. latitude, had not prospered, and its
      efforts at colonization (on what is now the Maine coast), in 1607 and
      later, had proved abortive, largely through the character of its
      &ldquo;settlers,&rdquo; who had been, in good degree, a somewhat notable mixture of
      two of the worst elements of society,&mdash;convicts and broken-down
      &ldquo;gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In 1607,&rdquo; says Goodwin, &ldquo;Gorges and the cruel Judge Popham planted a
      colony at Phillipsburg (or Sagadahoc, as is supposed), by the mouth of the
      Kennebec. Two ships came, &lsquo;THE GIFT OF GOD&rsquo; and the &lsquo;MARY AND JOHN,&rsquo;
      bringing a hundred persons. Through August they found all delightful, but
      when the ships went back in December, fifty five of the number returned to
      England, weary of their experience and fearful of the cold .... With
      spring the ships returned from England; &ldquo;but by this time the remainder
      were ready to leave,&rdquo; so every soul returned with Gilbert [the Admiral] .
      . . . For thirty years Gorges continued to push exploration and emigration
      to that region, but his ambition and liberality ever resulted in
      disappointment and loss.&rdquo; The annals of the time show that not a few of
      the Sagadahoc colonists were convicts, released from the English jails to
      people this colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hakluyt says: &ldquo;In 1607 [this should read 1608], disheartened by the death
      of Popham, they all embarked in a ship from Exeter and in the new pynnace,
      the &lsquo;VIRGINIA,&rsquo; built in the colony, and sett sail for England, and this
      was the end of that northern colony upon the river Sachadehoc [Kennebec].&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one knew better than the shrewd Gorges the value of such a colony as
      that of the Leyden brethren would be, to plant, populate, and develop his
      Company&rsquo;s great demesne. None were more facile than himself and the
      buccaneering Earl of Warwick, to plan and execute the bold, but&mdash;as
      it proved&mdash;easy coup, by which the Pilgrim colony was to be stolen
      bodily; for the benefit of the &ldquo;Second Virginia Company&rdquo; and its
      successor, &ldquo;the Council for New England,&rdquo; from the &ldquo;First (or London)
      Company,&rdquo; under whose patent (to John Pierce) and patronage they sailed.
      They apparently did not take their patent with them,&mdash;it would have
      been worthless if they had,&mdash;and they were destined to have no small
      trouble with Pierce, before they were established in their rights under
      the new patent granted him (in the interest of the Adventurers and
      themselves), by the &ldquo;Council for New England.&rdquo; Master John Wincob&rsquo;s early
      and silent withdrawal from his apparently active connection with the
      Pilgrim movement, and the evident cancellation of the first patent issued
      to him in its interest, by the (London) Virginia Company, have never been
      satisfactorily explained. Wincob (or Wincop), we are told, &ldquo;was a
      religious Gentleman, then belonging to the household of the Countess of
      Lincoln, who intended to go with them [the Pilgrims] but God so disposed
      as he never went, nor they ever made use of this Patent, which had cost
      them so much labor and charge.&rdquo; Wincob, it appears by the minutes of the
      (London) Virginia Company of Wednesday, May 26/June 5, 1619, was commended
      to the Company, for the patent he sought, by the fourth Earl of Lincoln,
      and it was doubtless through his influence that it was granted and sealed,
      June 9/19, 1619. But while Wincob was a member of the household of the
      Dowager Countess of Lincoln, mother of the fourth Earl of Lincoln; John,
      the eldest son of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, had married the Earl&rsquo;s daughter
      (sister ?), and hence Gorges stood in a much nearer relation to the Earl
      than did his mother&rsquo;s friend and dependant (as Wincob evidently was), as
      well as on a much more equal social footing. By the minutes of the
      (London) Virginia Company of Wednesday, February 2/ 12, 1619/20, it
      appears that a patent was &ldquo;allowed and sealed to John Pierce and his
      associates, heirs and assigns,&rdquo; for practically the same territory for
      which the patent to Wincob had been given but eight months before. No
      explanation was offered, and none appears of record, but the logical
      conclusion is, that the first patent had been cancelled, that Master
      Wincob&rsquo;s personal interest in the Pilgrim exodus had ceased, and that the
      Lincoln patronage had been withdrawn. It is a rational conjecture that Sir
      Ferdinando Gorges, through the relationship he sustained to the Earl,
      procured the withdrawal of Wincob and his patent, knowing that the success
      of his (Gorges&rsquo;s) plot would render the Wincob patent worthless, and that
      the theft of the colony, in his own interest, would be likely to breed
      &ldquo;unpleasantness&rdquo; between himself and Wincob&rsquo;s sponsors and friends among
      the Adventurers, many of whom were friends of the Earl of Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Warwick, the man of highest social and political rank in the
      First (or London) Virginia Company, was, at about the same time, induced
      by Gorges to abandon his (the London) Company and unite with himself in
      securing from the Crown the charter of the &ldquo;Council of Affairs for New
      England.&rdquo; The only inducements he could offer for the change must
      apparently have resided in the promised large results of plottings
      disclosed by him (Gorges), but he needed the influential and unscrupulous
      Earl for the promotion of his schemes, and won him, by some means, to an
      active partnership, which was doubtless congenial to both. The &ldquo;fine
      Italian hand&rdquo; of Sir Ferdinando hence appears at every stage, and in every
      phase, of the Leyden movement, from the mission of Weston to Holland, to
      the landing at Cape Cod, and every movement clearly indicates the crafty
      cunning, the skilful and brilliant manipulation, and the dogged
      determination of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Weston was a most pliant and efficient tool in the hands of Gorges,
      &ldquo;from start to finish&rdquo; of this undertaking, is certainly apparent. Whether
      he was, from the outset, made fully aware of the sinister designs of the
      chief conspirator, and a party to them, admits of some doubt, though the
      conviction strengthens with study, that he was, from the beginning,
      &lsquo;particeps criminis&rsquo;. If he was ever single-minded for the welfare of the
      Leyden brethren and the Adventurers, it must have been for a very brief
      time at the inception of the enterprise; and circumstances seem to forbid
      crediting him with honesty of purpose, even then. The weight of evidence
      indicates that he both knew, and was fully enlisted in, the entire plot of
      Gorges from the outset. In all its early stages he was its most efficient
      promoter, and seems to have given ample proof of his compliant zeal in its
      execution. His visit to the Leyden brethren in Holland was, apparently,
      wholly instigated by Gorges, as the latter complacently claims and
      collateral evidence proves. In his endeavor to induce the leaders to
      &ldquo;break off with the Dutch,&rdquo; their pending negotiations for settlement at
      &ldquo;Hudson&rsquo;s River,&rdquo; he evidently made capital of, and traded upon, his
      former kindness to some of them when they were in straits,&mdash;a most
      contemptible thing in itself, yet characteristic of the man. He led the
      Pilgrims to &ldquo;break off&rdquo; their dealings with the Dutch by the largest and
      most positive promises of greater advantages through him, few of which he
      ever voluntarily kept (as we see by John Robinson&rsquo;s sharp arraignment of
      him), his whole object being apparently to get the Leyden party into his
      control and that of his friends,&mdash;the most subtle and able of whom
      was Gorges. Bradford recites that Weston not only urged the Leyden leaders
      &ldquo;not to meddle with ye Dutch,&rdquo; but also,&mdash;&ldquo;not too much to depend on
      ye Virginia [London] Company,&rdquo; but to rely on himself and his friends.
      This strongly suggests active cooperation with Gorges, on Weston&rsquo;s part,
      at the outset, with the intent (if he could win them by any means, from
      allegiance to the First (London) Virginia Company), to lead the Leyden
      party, if possible, into Gorges&rsquo;s hands and under the control and
      patronage of the Second (or Plymouth) Virginia Company. Whatever the date
      may have been, at which (as Bradford states) the Leyden people &ldquo;heard,
      both by Mr. Weston and others, yt sundrie Honble: Lords had obtained a
      large grante from ye king for ye more northerly parts of that countrie,
      derived out of ye Virginia patents, and wholly secluded from theire
      Governmente, and to be called by another name, viz. New England, unto
      which Mr. Weston and the chiefe of them begane to incline;&rdquo; Bradford
      leaves us in no doubt as to Weston&rsquo;s attitude toward the matter itself. It
      is certain that the governor, writing from memory, long afterward, fixed
      the time at which the Honble: Lords had obtained &ldquo;their large grante&rdquo; much
      earlier than it could possibly have occurred, as we know the exact date of
      the patent for the, &ldquo;Council for New England,&rdquo; and that the order for its
      issue was not given till just as the Pilgrims left Leyden; so that they
      could not have known of the actual &ldquo;grante&rdquo; till they reached Southampton.
      The essential fact, stated on this best of authority, is, that &ldquo;Mr. Weston
      and the chiefe of them [their sponsors, i.e. Weston and Lord Warwick, both
      in league with Gorges] begane to incline to Gorges&rsquo;s new Council for New
      England.&rdquo; Such an attitude (evidently taken insidiously) meant, on
      Weston&rsquo;s part, of necessity, no less than treachery to his associates of
      the Adventurers; to the (London) Virginia Company, and to the Leyden
      company and their allied English colonists, in the interest of Sir
      Ferdinando Gorges and his schemes and of the new &ldquo;Council&rdquo; that Gorges was
      organizing. Weston&rsquo;s refusal to advance &ldquo;a penny&rdquo; to clear the departing
      Pilgrims from their port charges at Southampton; his almost immediate
      severance of connection with both the colonists and the Adventurers; and
      his early association with Gorges,&mdash;in open and disgraceful violation
      of all the formers&rsquo; rights in New England,&mdash;to say nothing of his
      exhibition of a malevolence rarely exercised except toward those one has
      deeply wronged, all point to a complete and positive surrender of himself
      and his energies to the plot of Gorges, as a full participant, from its
      inception. In his review of the Anniversary Address of Hon. Charles
      Francis Adams (of July 4, 1892, at Quincy), Daniel W. Baker, Esq., of
      Boston, says: &ldquo;The Pilgrim Fathers were influenced in their decision to
      come to New England by Weston, who, if not the agent of Gorges in this
      particular matter, was such in other matters and held intimate relations
      with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The known facts favor the belief that Gorges&rsquo;s cogitations on colonial
      matters&mdash;especially as stimulated by his plottings in relation to the
      Leyden people&mdash;led to his project of the grant&mdash;and charter for
      the new &ldquo;Council for New England,&rdquo; designed and constituted to supplant,
      or override, all others. It is highly probable that this grand scheme
      &mdash;duly embellished by the crafty Gorges,&mdash;being unfolded to
      Weston, with suggestions of great opportunities for Weston himself
      therein, warmed and drew him, and brought him to full and zealous
      cooperation in all Gorges&rsquo;s plans, and that from this time, as Bradford
      states, he &ldquo;begane to incline&rdquo; toward, and to suggest to the Pilgrims,
      association with Gorges and the new &ldquo;Council.&rdquo; Not daring openly to
      declare his change of allegiance and his perfidy, he undertook,
      apparently, at first, by suggestions, e.g. &ldquo;not to place too much
      dependence on the London Company, but to rely on himself and friends;&rdquo;
       that &ldquo;the fishing of New England was good,&rdquo; etc.; and making thus no
      headway, then, by a policy of delay, fault finding, etc., to breed
      dissatisfaction, on the Pilgrims&rsquo; part, with the Adventurers, the patent
      of Wincob, etc., with the hope of bringing about &ldquo;a new deal&rdquo; in the
      Gorges interest. The same &ldquo;delays&rdquo; in sailing, that have been adduced as
      proof of Jones&rsquo;s complicity with the Dutch, would have been of equal
      advantage to these noble schemers, and if he had any hand in them-which
      does not appear&mdash;it would have been far more likely in the interest
      of his long-time patron, the Earl of Warwick, and of his friends, than of
      any Dutch conspirators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the colonists were landed upon the American soil, especially if late
      in the season, they would not be likely, it doubtless was argued, to
      remove; while by a liberal policy on the part of the &ldquo;Council for New
      England&rdquo; toward them&mdash;when they discovered that they were upon its
      territory&mdash;they could probably be retained. That just such a policy
      was, at once and eagerly, adopted toward them, as soon as occasion
      permitted, is good proof that the scheme was thoroughly matured from the
      start. The record of the action of the &ldquo;Council for New England&rdquo;&mdash;which
      had become the successor of the Second Virginia Company before
      intelligence was received that the Pilgrims had landed on its domain&mdash;is
      not at hand, but it appears by the record of the London Company, under
      date of Monday, July 16/26, 1621, that the &ldquo;Council for New England&rdquo; had
      promptly made itself agreeable to the colonists. The record reads: &ldquo;It was
      moved, seeing that Master John Pierce had taken a Patent of Sir Ferdinando
      Gorges, and thereupon seated his Company [the Pilgrims] within the limits
      of the Northern Plantations, as by some was supposed,&rdquo;&rsquo; etc. From this it
      is plain that, on receipt by Pierce of the news that the colony was landed
      within the limits of the &ldquo;Council for New England,&rdquo; he had, as instructed,
      applied for, and been given (June 1, 1621), the (first) &ldquo;Council&rdquo; patent
      for the colony. For confirmation hereof one should see also the minutes of
      the &ldquo;Council for New England&rdquo; of March 25/April 4., 1623, and the fulsome
      letter of Robert Cushman returning thanks in behalf of the Planters
      (through John Pierce), to Gorges, for his prompt response to their request
      for a patent and for his general complacency toward them Hon. James
      Phinney Baxter, Gorges&rsquo;s able and faithful biographer, says: &ldquo;We can
      imagine with what alacrity he [Sir Ferdinando] hastened to give to Pierce
      a patent in their behalf.&rdquo; The same biographer, clearly unconscious of the
      well-laid plot of Gorges and Warwick (as all other writers but Neill and
      Davis have been), bears testimony (all the stronger because the witness is
      unwitting of the intrigue), to the ardent interest Gorges had in its
      success. He says: &ldquo;The warm desire of Sir Ferdinando Gorges to see a
      permanent colony founded within the domain of the Plymouth [or Second]
      Virginia Company was to be realized in a manner of which he had never
      dreamed [sic!] and by a people with whom he had but little sympathized,
      although we know that he favored their settlement within the territorial
      limits of the Plymouth [Second] Company.&rdquo; He had indeed &ldquo;favored their
      settlement,&rdquo; by all the craft of which he was master, and greeted their
      expected and duly arranged advent with all the jubilant open-handedness
      with which the hunter treats the wild horse he has entrapped, and hopes to
      domesticate and turn to account. Everything favored the conspirators. The
      deflection north-ward from the normal course of the ship as she approached
      the coast, bound for the latitude of the Hudson, required only to be so
      trifling that the best sailor of the Pilgrim leaders would not be likely
      to note or criticise it, and it was by no means uncommon to make Cape Cod
      as the first landfall on Virginia voyages. The lateness of the arrival on
      the coast, and the difficulties ever attendant on doubling Cape Cod,
      properly turned to account, would increase the anxiety for almost any
      landing-place, and render it easy to retain the sea-worn colonists when
      once on shore. The grand advantage, however, over and above all else, was
      the entire ease and certainty with which the cooperation of the one man
      essential to the success of the undertaking could be secured, without need
      of the privity of any other, viz. the Master of the MAY-FLOWER, Captain
      Thomas Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us see upon what the assumption of this ready and certain accord on
      the part of Captain Jones rests. Rev. Dr. Neill, whose thorough study of
      the records of the Virginia Companies, and of the East India Company
      Calendars and collateral data, entitles him to speak with authority,
      recites that, &ldquo;In 1617, Capt. Thomas Jones (sometimes spelled Joanes) had
      been sent to the East Indies in command of the ship LION by the Earl of
      Warwick (then Sir Robt. Rich), under a letter of protection from the Duke
      of Savoy, a foreign prince, ostensibly &lsquo;to take pirates,&rsquo; which [pretext]
      had grown, as Sir Thomas Roe (the English ambassador with the Great Mogul)
      states, &lsquo;to be a common pretence for becoming pirate.&rsquo;&rdquo; Caught by the
      famous Captain Martin Pring, in full pursuit of the junk of the Queen
      Mother of the Great Mogul, Jones was attacked, his ship fired in the
      fight, and burned,&mdash;with some of his crew,&mdash;and he was sent a
      prisoner to England in the ship BULL, arriving in the Thames, January 1,
      1618/19. No action seems to have been taken against him for his offences,
      and presumably his employer, Sir Robert, the coming Earl, obtained his
      liberty on one pretext or another. On January 19, however, complaint was
      made against Captain Jones, &ldquo;late of the LION,&rdquo; by the East India Company,
      &ldquo;for hiring divers men to serve the King of Denmark in the East Indies.&rdquo; A
      few days after his arrest for &ldquo;hiring away the Company&rsquo;s men, Lord Warwick
      got him off&rdquo; on the claim that he had employed him &ldquo;to go to Virginia with
      cattle.&rdquo; From the &ldquo;Transactions&rdquo; of the Second Virginia Company, of which&mdash;as
      we have seen&mdash;Sir Ferdinando Gorges was the leading spirit, it
      appears that on &ldquo;February 2, 1619/20, a commission was allowed Captain
      Thomas Jones of the FALCON, a ship of 150 tons&rdquo; [he having been lately
      released from arrest by the Earl of Warwick&rsquo;s intercession], and that
      &ldquo;before the close of the month, he sailed with cattle for Virginia,&rdquo; as
      previously noted. Dr. Neill, than whom there can be no better authority,
      was himself satisfied, and unequivocally states, that &ldquo;Thomas Jones,
      Captain of the MAY-FLOWER, was without doubt the old servant of Lord
      Warwick in the East Indies.&rdquo; Having done Sir Robert Rich&rsquo;s (the Earl of
      Warwick&rsquo;s) &ldquo;dirty work&rdquo; for years, and having on all occasions been saved
      from harm by his noble patron (even when piracy and similar practices had
      involved him in the meshes of the law), it would be but a trifling matter,
      at the request of such powerful friends as the Earl and Sir Ferdinando
      Gorges, to steal the Pilgrim Colony from the London Virginia Company, and
      hand it over bodily to the &ldquo;Council for New England,&rdquo;&mdash;the successor
      of the Second (Plymouth) Virginia Company,&mdash;in which their interests
      were vested, Warwick having, significantly, transferred his membership
      from the London Company to the new &ldquo;Council for New England,&rdquo; as it was
      commonly called. Neill states, and there is abundant proof, that &ldquo;the Earl
      of Warwick and Gorges were in sympathy,&rdquo; and were active coadjutors, while
      it is self-evident that both would be anxious to accomplish the permanent
      settlement of the &ldquo;Northern Plantations&rdquo; held by their Company. That they
      would hesitate to utilize so excellent an opportunity to secure so very
      desirable a colony, by any means available, our knowledge of the men and
      their records makes it impossible to believe,&mdash;while nothing could
      apparently have been easier of accomplishment. It will readily be
      understood that if the conspirators were these men,&mdash;upon whose grace
      the Pilgrims must depend for permission to remain upon the territory to
      which they had been inveigled, or even for permission to depart from it,
      without spoliation, &mdash;men whose influence with the King (no friend to
      the Pilgrims) was sufficient to make both of them, in the very month of
      the Pilgrims&rsquo; landing, &ldquo;governors&rdquo; of &ldquo;The Council for New England,&rdquo; under
      whose authority the Planters must remain,&mdash;the latter were not likely
      to voice their suspicions of the trick played upon them, if they
      discovered it, or openly to resent it, when known. Dr. Dexter, in
      commenting on the remark of Bradford, &ldquo;We made Master Jones our leader,
      for we thought it best herein to gratifie his kindness &amp; forwardness,&rdquo;
       sensibly says, &ldquo;This proves nothing either way, in regard to the charge
      which Secretary Morton makes of treachery against Jones, in landing the
      company so far north, because, if that were true, it was not known to any
      of the company for years afterward, and of course could not now [at that
      time] impair their feelings of confidence in, or kindness towards, him.
      Moreover, the phraseology, &ldquo;we thought it best to gratifie,&rdquo; suggests
      rather considerations of policy than cordial desire, and their
      acquaintance, too, with the man was still young. There is, however, no
      evidence that Jones&rsquo;s duplicity was suspected till long afterward, though
      his character was fully recognized. Gorges himself furnishes, in his
      writings, the strongest confirmation we have of the already apparent fact,
      that he was himself the prime conspirator. He says, in his own
      &ldquo;Narration,&rdquo; &ldquo;It was referred [evidently by himself] to their [the London
      Virginia Company&rsquo;s] consideration, how necessary it was that means might
      be used to draw unto those their enterprises, some of those families that
      had retired themselves into Holland for scruple of conscience, giving them
      such freedom and liberty as might stand with their liking.&rdquo; When have we
      ever found Sir Ferdinando Gorges thus solicitous for the success of the
      rival Virginia Company? Why, if he so esteemed the Leyden people as
      excellent colonists, did he not endeavor to secure them himself directly,
      for his own languishing company? Certainly the &ldquo;scruple of conscience&rdquo; of
      the Leyden brethren did not hinder him, for he found it no bar, though of
      the Established Church himself, to giving them instantly all and more than
      was asked in their behalf, as soon as he had them upon his territory and
      they had applied for a patent. He well knew that it would be matter of
      some expense and difficulty to bring the Leyden congregation into
      agreement to go to either of the Virginia grants, and he doubtless, and
      with good reason, feared that his repute and the character and reputation
      of his own Company, with its past history of failure, convict settlers,
      and loose living, would be repellent to these people of &ldquo;conscience.&rdquo; If
      they could be brought to the &ldquo;going-point,&rdquo; by men more of their ilk, like
      Sir Edwin Sandys, Weston, and others, it would then be time to see if he
      could not pluck the ripe fruit for himself,&mdash;as he seems to have
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This advice,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;being hearkened unto, there were [those] that
      undertook the putting it in practice [Weston and others] and it was
      accordingly brought to effect,&rdquo; etc. Then, reciting (erroneously) the
      difficulties with the SPEEDWELL, etc., he records the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S arrival
      at Cape Cod, saying, &ldquo;The . . . ship with great difficulty reached the
      coast of New England.&rdquo; He then gives a glowing, though absurd, account of
      the attractions the planters found&mdash;in midwinter &mdash;especially
      naming the hospitable reception of the Indians, despite the fact of the
      savage attack made upon them by the Nausets at Cape Cod, and adds: &ldquo;After
      they had well considered the state of their affairs and found that the
      authority they had from the London Company of Virginia, could not warrant
      their abode in that place,&rdquo; which &ldquo;they found so prosperous and pleasing
      [sic] they hastened away their ship, with orders to their Solicitor to
      deal with me to be a means they might have a grant from the Council of New
      England Affairs, to settle in the place, which was accordingly performed
      to their particular satisfaction and good content of them all.&rdquo; One can
      readily imagine the crafty smile with which Sir Ferdinando thus
      guilelessly recorded the complete success of his plot. It is of interest
      to note how like a needle to the pole the grand conspirator&rsquo;s mind flies
      to the fact which most appeals to him &mdash;that they find &ldquo;that the
      authority they had . . . could not warrant their abode in that place.&rdquo; It
      is of like interest to observe that in that place which he called
      &ldquo;pleasant and prosperous&rdquo; one half their own and of the ship&rsquo;s company had
      died before they hastened the ship away, and they had endured trial,
      hardships, and sorrows untellable,&mdash;although from pluck and principle
      they would not abandon it. He tells us &ldquo;they hastened away their ship,&rdquo;
       and implies that it was for the chief purpose of obtaining through him a
      grant of the land they occupied. While we know that the ship did not
      return till the following April,&mdash;and then at her Captain&rsquo;s rather
      than the Pilgrims&rsquo; pleasure,&mdash;it is evident that Gorges could think
      of events only as incident to his designs and from his point of view. His
      plot had succeeded. He had the &ldquo;Holland families&rdquo; upon his soil, and his
      willing imagination converted their sober and deliberate action into the
      eager haste with which he had planned that they should fly to him for the
      patent, which his cunning had&mdash;as he purposed&mdash;rendered
      necessary. Of course their request &ldquo;was performed,&rdquo; and so readily and
      delightedly that, recognizing John Pierce as their mouthpiece and the
      plantation as &ldquo;Mr. Pierces Plantation,&rdquo; Sir Ferdinando and his associates&mdash;the
      &ldquo;Council for New England,&rdquo; including his joint-conspirator, the Earl of
      Warwick&mdash;gave Pierce unhesitatingly whatever he asked. The Hon.
      William T. Davis, who alone among Pilgrim historians (except Dr. Neill,
      whom he follows) seems to have suspected the hand of Gorges in the
      treachery of Captain Jones, here demonstrated, has suggested that:
      &ldquo;Whether Gorges might not have influenced Pierce, in whose name the patent
      of the Pilgrims had been issued&mdash;and whether both together might not
      have seduced Capt. Jones, are further considerations to be weighed, in
      solving the problem of a deviation from the intended voyage of the
      MAYFLOWER.&rdquo; Although not aware of these suggestions, either of Mr. Davis
      or of Dr. Neill, till his own labors had satisfied him of Gorges&rsquo;s guilt,
      and his conclusions were formed, the author cheerfully recognizes the
      priority to his own demonstration, of the suggestions of both these
      gentlemen. No thing appears of record, however, to indicate that John
      Pierce was in any way a party to Gorges&rsquo;s plot. On the contrary, as his
      interest was wholly allied to his patent, which Gorges&rsquo;s scheme would
      render of little value to his associate Adventurers and himself he would
      naturally have been, unless heavily bribed to duplicity beyond his
      expectations from their intended venture, the last man to whom to disclose
      such a conspiracy. Neither was he necessary in any way to the success of
      the scheme. He did not hire either the ship or her master; he does not
      appear to have had any Pilgrim relations to Captain Jones, and certainly
      could have had no such influence with him as Gorges could himself command,
      through Warwick and his own ability&mdash;from his position at the head of
      the &ldquo;New England Council&rdquo;&mdash;to reward the service he required. That
      Gorges was able himself to exert all the influence requisite to secure
      Jones&rsquo;s cooperation, without the aid of Pierce, who probably could have
      given none, is evident. Mr. Davis&rsquo;s suggestion, while pertinent and
      potential as to Gorges, is clearly wide of the mark as to Pierce. He
      represented the Adventurers in the matter of patents only, but Weston was
      in authority as to the pivotal matter of shipping. An evidently hasty
      footnote of Dr. Neill, appended to the &ldquo;Memorial&rdquo; offered by him to the
      Congress of the United States, in 1868, seems to have been the only
      authority of Mr. William T. Davis for the foregoing suggestion as to the
      complicity of Pierce in the treachery of Captain Jones, except the bare
      suspicion, already alluded to, in the records of the London Company. Neill
      says: &ldquo;Captain Jones, the navigator of the MAY-FLOWER, and John Pierce,
      probably had arranged as to destination without the knowledge of the
      passengers.&rdquo; While of course this is not impossible, there is, as stated,
      absolutely nothing to indicate any knowledge, participation, or need of
      Pierce in the matter, and of course the fewer there were in the secret the
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unobservant that John Pierce was acting upon the old adage, &ldquo;second thief
      best owner,&rdquo; when he asked, a little later, even so extraordinary a thing
      as that the &ldquo;Council for New England&rdquo; would exchange the patent they had
      so promptly granted him (as representing his associates, the Adventurers
      and Planters) for a &ldquo;deed-pole,&rdquo; or title in fee, to himself alone, they
      instantly complied, and thus unwittingly enabled him also to steal the
      colony, and its demesne beside. It is evident, from the very servile
      letter of Robert Cushman to John Pierce (written while the former was at
      New Plymouth, in November-December, 1621, on behalf of the MAY-FLOWER
      Adventurers), that up to that time at least, the Pilgrims had no suspicion
      of the trick which had been played upon them. For, while too adroit
      recklessly to open a quarrel with those who could&mdash;if they chose
      &mdash;destroy them, the Pilgrims were far too high-minded to stoop to
      flattery and dissimulation (especially with any one known to have been
      guilty of treachery toward them), or to permit any one to do so in their
      stead. In the letter referred to, Cush man acknowledges in the name of the
      colonists the &ldquo;bounty and grace of the President and Council of the
      Affairs of New England [Gorges, Warwick, et als.] for their allowance and
      approbation&rdquo; of the &ldquo;free possession and enjoyment&rdquo; of the territory and
      rights so promptly granted Pierce by the Council, in the colonists&rsquo;
      interest, upon application. If the degree of promptness with which the
      wily Gorges and his associates granted the petition of Pierce, in the
      colony&rsquo;s behalf for authority to occupy the domain to which Gorges&rsquo;s
      henchman Jones had so treacherously conveyed them, was at all
      proportionate to the fulsome and lavish acknowledgments of Cushman, there
      must have been such eagerness of compliance as to provoke general
      suspicion at the Council table. Gorges and Warwick must have &ldquo;grinned
      horribly behind their hands&rdquo; upon receipt of the honest thanks of these
      honest planters and the pious benedictions of their scribe, knowing
      themselves guilty of detestable conspiracy and fraud, which had frustrated
      an honest purpose, filched the results of others&rsquo; labors, and had &ldquo;done to
      death&rdquo; good men and women not a few. Winslow, in &ldquo;Hypocrisie Unmasked,&rdquo;
       says: &ldquo;We met with many dangers and the mariners&rsquo; put back into the harbor
      of the Cape.&rdquo; The original intent of the Pilgrims to go to the
      neighborhood of the Hudson is unmistakable; that this intention was still
      clear on the morning of November 10 (not 9th) &mdash;after they had &ldquo;made
      the land&rdquo;&mdash;has been plainly shown; that there was no need of so
      &ldquo;standing in with the land&rdquo; as to become entangled in the &ldquo;rips&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;shoals&rdquo; off what is now known as Monomoy (in an effort to pass around the
      Cape to the southward, when there was plenty of open water to port), is
      clear and certain; that the dangers and difficulties were magnified by
      Jones, and the abandonment of the effort was urged and practically made by
      him, is also evident from Winslow&rsquo;s language above noted,&mdash;&ldquo;and the
      mariners put back,&rdquo; etc. No indication of the old-time consultations with
      the chief men appears here as to the matter of the return. Their advice
      was not desired. &ldquo;The mariners put back&rdquo; on their own responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goodwin forcibly remarks, &ldquo;These waters had been navigated by Gosnold,
      Smith, and various English and French explorers, whose descriptions and
      charts must have been familiar to a veteran master like Jones. He
      doubtless magnified the danger of the passage [of the shoals], and managed
      to have only such efforts made as were sure to fail. Of course he knew
      that by standing well out, and then southward in the clear sea, he would
      be able to bear up for the Hudson. His professed inability to devise any
      way for getting south of the Cape is strong proof of guilt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sequential acts of the Gorges conspiracy were doubtless practically as
      follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) The Leyden leaders applied to the States General of Holland, through
      the New Netherland Company, for their aid and protection in locating at
      the mouth of &ldquo;Hudson&rsquo;s&rdquo; River;
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) Sir Dudley Carleton, the English ambassador at the Hague, doubtless
      promptly reported these negotiations to the King, through Sir Robert
      Naunton;
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) The King, naturally enough, probably mentioned the matter to his
      intimate and favorite, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, the leading man in American
      colonization matters in the kingdom;
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) Sir Ferdinando Gorges, recognizing the value of such colonists as the
      Leyden congregation would make, anxious to secure them, instead of
      permitting the Dutch to do so, and knowing that he and his Company would
      be obnoxious to the Leyden leaders, suggested, as he admits, to Weston,
      perhaps to Sandys, as the Leyden brethren&rsquo;s friends, that they ought to
      secure them as colonists for their (London) Company;
    </p>
    <p>
      (e) Weston was dispatched to Holland to urge the Leyden leaders to drop
      the Dutch negotiations, come under English auspices, which he guaranteed,
      and they, placing faith in him, and possibly in Sandys&rsquo;s assurances of his
      (London) Virginia Company&rsquo;s favor, were led to put themselves completely
      into the hands of Weston and the Merchant Adventurers; the Wincob patent
      was cancelled and Pierces substituted;
    </p>
    <p>
      (f) Weston, failing to lead them to Gorges&rsquo;s company, was next deputed,
      perhaps by Gorges&rsquo;s secret aid, to act with full powers for the
      Adventurers, in securing shipping, etc.;
    </p>
    <p>
      (g) Having made sure of the Leyden party, and being in charge of the
      shipping, Weston was practically master of the situation. He and Cushman,
      who was clearly entirely innocent of the conspiracy, had the hiring of the
      ship and of her officers, and at this point he and his acts were of vital
      importance to Gorges&rsquo;s plans. To bring the plot to a successful issue it
      remained only to effect the landing of the colony upon territory north of
      the 41st parallel of north latitude, to take it out of the London
      Company&rsquo;s jurisdiction, and to do this it was only necessary to make Jones
      Master of the ship and to instruct him accordingly. This, with so willing
      a servant of his masters, was a matter of minutes only, the instructions
      were evidently given, and the success of the plot&mdash;the theft of the
      MAY-FLOWER colony&mdash;was assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a careful and candid student of all the facts, the proofs are seemingly
      unmistakable, and the conclusion is unavoidable, that the MAY-FLOWER
      Pilgrims were designedly brought to Cape Cod by Captain Jones, and their
      landing in that latitude was effected, in pursuance of a conspiracy
      entered into by him, not with the Dutch, but with certain of the nobility
      of England; not with the purpose of keeping the planters out of Dutch
      territory, but with the deliberate intent of stealing the colony from the
      London Virginia Company, under whose auspices it had organized and set
      sail, in the interest, and to the advantage, of its rival Company of the
      &ldquo;Northern Plantations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is noteworthy that Jones did not command the MAY-FLOWER for another
      voyage, and never sailed afterward in the employ of Thomas Goffe, Esq., or
      (so far as appears) of any reputable shipowner. Weston was not such, nor
      were the chiefs of the &ldquo;Council for New England,&rdquo; in whose employ he
      remained till his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The records of the Court of the &ldquo;Council&rdquo; show, that &ldquo;as soon as it would
      do,&rdquo; and when his absence would tend to lull suspicion as to the parts
      played, Captain Jones&rsquo;s noble patrons took steps to secure for him due
      recognition and compensation for his services, from the parties who were
      to benefit directly, with themselves, by his knavery. The records read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;July 17, 1622. A motion was made in the behaffe of Captaine Thomas Jones,
      Captaine of the DISCOVERY, nowe employed in Virginia for trade and
      fishinge [it proved, apparently, rather to be piracy], that he may be
      admitted a freeman in this Companie in reward of the good service he hath
      there [Virginia in general] performed. The Court liked well of the motion
      and condiscended thereunto.&rdquo; The DISCOVERY left London at the close of
      November, 1621. She arrived at Jamestown, Virginia, in April, 1622. She
      reached Plymouth, New England, in August, 1622. Her outward voyage was
      not, so far as can be learned, eventful, or entitled to especial
      consideration or recognition, and the good store of English trading-goods
      she still had on hand&mdash;as Governor Bradford notices&mdash;on her
      arrival at Plymouth indicates no notable success up to that time, in the
      way of a trading-voyage, while &ldquo;fishing&rdquo; is not mentioned. For piracy, in
      which she was later more successful, she had then had neither time nor
      opportunity. The conclusion is irresistible, that &ldquo;the good service&rdquo;
       recognized by the vote recorded was of the past (he had sailed only the
      MAY-FLOWER voyage for the &ldquo;Council&rdquo; before), and that this recognition was
      a part of the compensation previously agreed upon, if, in the matter of
      the MAY-FLOWER voyage, Captain Jones did as he was bidden. Thus much of
      the crafty Master of the MAY-FLOWER, Captain Thomas Jones,&mdash;his
      Christian name and identity both apparently beyond dispute, &mdash;whom we
      first know in the full tide of his piratical career, in the corsair LION
      in Eastern seas; whom we next find as a prisoner in London for his
      misconduct in the East, but soon Master of the cattle-ship FALCON on her
      Virginia voyage; whom we greet next&mdash;and best&mdash;as Admiral of the
      Pilgrim fleet, commander of the destiny freighted MAY-FLOWER, and though a
      conspirator with nobles against the devoted band he steered, under the
      overruling hand of their Lord God, their unwitting pilot to &ldquo;imperial
      labors&rdquo; and mighty honors, to the founding of empire, and to eternal
      Peace; whom we next meet&mdash;fallen, &ldquo;like Lucifer, never to hope again&rdquo;
       &mdash;as Captain of the little buccaneer,&mdash;the DISCOVERY, disguised
      as a trading-ship, on the Virginian and New England coasts; and lastly, in
      charge of his leaking prize, a Spanish frigate in West Indian waters,
      making his way&mdash;death-stricken&mdash;into the Virginia port of
      Jamestown, where (July, 1625), he &ldquo;cast anchor&rdquo; for the last time, dying,
      as we first found him, a pirate, to whom it had meantime been given to
      &ldquo;minister unto saints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of JOHN CLARKE, the first mate of the MAY-FLOWER, we have already learned
      that he had been in the employ of the First (or London) Virginia Company,
      and had but just returned (in June, 1620) from a voyage to Virginia with
      Captain Jones in the FALCON, when found and employed by Weston and Cushman
      for the Pilgrim ship. Dr. Neill quotes from the &ldquo;Minutes of the London
      Virginia Company,&rdquo; of Wednesday, February 13/23, 1621/2, the following;
      which embodies considerable information concerning him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;February 13th, 1621. Master Deputy acquainted the Court, that one Master
      John Clarke being taken from Virginia long since [Arber interpolates, &ldquo;in
      1612&rdquo;] by a Spanish ship that came to discover the Plantation, that
      forasmuch as he hath since that time done the Company presumably the First
      (or London) Virginia Company good service in many voyages to Virginia;
      and, of late [1619] went into
      Ireland, for the transportation of cattle to Virginia; he was a humble
      suitor to this Court that he might be a Free brother of the Company, and
      have some shares of land bestowed upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the foregoing he seems to have begun his American experiences as
      early as 1612, and to have frequently repeated them. That he was at once
      hired by Weston and Cushman as a valuable man, as soon as found, was not
      strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seems to have had the ability to impress men favorably and secure their
      confidence, and to have been a modest and reliable man. Although of both
      experience and capacity, he continued an under-officer for some years
      after the Pilgrim voyage, when, it is fair to suppose, he might have had
      command of a ship. He seems to have lacked confidence in himself, or else
      the breadth of education necessary to make him trust his ability as a
      navigator.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is not mentioned, in connection with the affairs of the Pilgrims, after
      he was hired as &ldquo;pilot,&rdquo;&mdash;on Saturday afternoon the 10th of June,
      1620, at London,&mdash;until after the arrival at Cape Cod, and evidently
      was steadily occupied during all the experience of &ldquo;getting away&rdquo; and of
      the voyage, in the faithful performance of his duty as first mate (or
      &ldquo;pilot&rdquo;) of the MAY-FLOWER. It was not until the &ldquo;third party&rdquo; of
      exploration from Cape Cod harbor was organized and set out, on Wednesday,
      December 6, that he appeared as one of the company who put out in the
      shallop, to seek the harbor which had been commended by Coppin, &ldquo;the
      second mate.&rdquo; On this eventful voyage&mdash;when the party narrowly
      escaped shipwreck at the mouth of Plymouth harbor&mdash;they found shelter
      under the lee of an island, which (it being claimed traditionally that he
      was first to land there on) was called, in his honor, &ldquo;Clarke&rsquo;s Island,&rdquo;
       which name it retains to this day. No other mention of him is made by
      name, in the affairs of ship or shore, though it is known inferentially
      that he survived the general illness which attacked and carried off half
      of the ship&rsquo;s company. In November, 1621,&mdash;the autumn following his
      return from the Pilgrim voyage,&mdash;he seems to have gone to Virginia as
      &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; (or &ldquo;mate&rdquo;) of the FLYING HART, with cattle of Daniel Gookin, and
      in 1623 to have attained command of a ship, the PROVIDENCE, belonging to
      Mr. Gookin, on a voyage to Virginia where he arrived April 10, 1623, but
      died in that colony soon after his arrival. He seems to have been a
      competent and faithful man, who filled well his part in life. He will
      always have honorable mention as the first officer of the historic
      MAY-FLOWER, and as sponsor at the English christening of the smiling islet
      in Plymouth harbor which bears his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of ROBERT COPPIN, the &ldquo;second mate&rdquo; (or &ldquo;pilot&rdquo;) of the MAY-FLOWER,
      nothing is known before his voyage in the Pilgrim ship, except that he
      seems to have made a former to the coast of New England and the vicinity
      of Cape Cod, though under what auspices, or in what ship, does not
      transpire. Bradford says: &ldquo;Their Pilotte, one Mr. Coppin, who had been in
      the countrie before.&rdquo; Dr. Young a suggests that Coppin was perhaps on the
      coast with Smith or Hunt. Mrs. Austin imaginatively makes him, of &ldquo;the
      whaling bark SCOTSMAN of Glasgow,&rdquo; but no warrant whatever for such a
      conception appears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Dexter, as elsewhere noted, has said: &ldquo;My impression is that Coppin
      was originally hired to go in the SPEEDWELL, . . . that he sailed with
      them [the Pilgrims] in the SPEED WELL, but on her final putting back was
      transferred to the MAY-FLOWER.&rdquo; As we have seen in another relation, Dr.
      Dexter also believed Coppin to have been the &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; sent over by Cushman
      to Leyden, in May, 1620, and we have found both views to be untenable. It
      was doubtless because of this mistaken view that Dr. Dexter believed that
      Coppin was &ldquo;hired to go in the SPEEDWELL,&rdquo; and, the premise being wrong,
      the conclusion is sequentially incorrect. But there are abundant reasons
      for thinking that Dexter&rsquo;s &ldquo;impression&rdquo; is wholly mistaken. It would be
      unreasonable to suppose (as both vessels were expected to cross the
      ocean), that each had not&mdash;certainly on leaving Southampton her full
      complement of officers. If so, each undoubtedly had her second mate. The
      MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S officers and crew were, as we know, hired for the voyage, and
      there is no good reason to suppose that the second mate of the MAY-FLOWER
      was dismissed at Plymouth and Coppin put in his place which would not be
      equally potent for such an exchange between the first mate of the
      SPEEDWELL and Clarke of the MAY-FLOWER. The assumption presumes too much.
      In fact, there can be no doubt that Dexter&rsquo;s misconception was enbased
      upon, and arose from, the unwarranted impression that Coppin was the
      &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; sent over to Leyden. It is not likely that, when the SPEEDWELL&rsquo;S
      officers were so evidently anxious to escape the voyage, they would seek
      transfer to the MAY-FLOWER.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Deane, the editor of Bradford&rsquo;s &ldquo;Historie&rdquo; (ed.1865), makes, in
      indexing, the clerical error of referring to Coppin as the
      &ldquo;master-gunner,&rdquo; an error doubtless occasioned by the fact that in the
      text referred to, the words, &ldquo;two of the masters-mates, Master Clarke and
      Master Coppin, the master-gunner,&rdquo; etc., were run so near together that
      the mistake was readily made.
    </p>
    <p>
      In &ldquo;Mourt&rsquo;s Relation&rdquo; it appears that in the conferences that were held
      aboard the ship in Cape Cod harbor, as to the most desirable place for the
      colonists to locate, &ldquo;Robert Coppin our pilot, made relation of a great
      navigable river and great harbor in the headland of the Bay, almost right
      over against Cape Cod, being a right line not much above eight leagues
      distant,&rdquo; etc. Mrs. Jane G. Austin asserts, though absolutely without
      warrant of any reliable authority, known tradition, or probability, that
      &ldquo;Coppin&rsquo;s harbor . . . afterward proved to be Cut River and the site of
      Marshfield,&rdquo; but in another place she contradicts this by stating that it
      was &ldquo;Jones River, Duxbury.&rdquo; As Coppin described his putative harbor,
      called &ldquo;Thievish Harbor,&rdquo; a &ldquo;great navigable river and good harbor&rdquo; were
      in close relation, which was never true of either the Jones River or &ldquo;Cut
      River&rdquo; localities, while any one familiar with the region knows that what
      Mrs. Austin knew as &ldquo;Cut River&rdquo; had no existence in the Pilgrims&rsquo; early
      days, but was the work of man, superseding a small river-mouth (Green
      Harbor River), which was so shallow as to have its exit closed by the
      sand-shift of a single storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young, with almost equal recklessness, says: &ldquo;The other headland of the
      bay,&rdquo; alluded to by Coppin, was Manomet Point, and the river was probably
      the North River in Scituate; but there are no &ldquo;great navigable river and
      good harbor&rdquo; in conjunction in the neighborhood of Manomet, or of the
      North River,&mdash;the former having no river and the latter no harbor. If
      Coppin had not declared that he had never seen the mouth of Plymouth
      harbor before (&ldquo;mine eyes never saw this place before&rdquo;), it might readily
      have been believed that Plymouth harbor was the &ldquo;Thievish Harbor&rdquo; of his
      description, so well do they correspond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goodwin, the brother of Mrs. Austin, quite at variance with his sister&rsquo;s
      conclusions, states, with every probability confirming him, that the
      harbor Coppin sought &ldquo;may have been Boston, Ipswich, Newburyport, or
      Portsmouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a result of his &ldquo;relation&rdquo; as to a desirable harbor, Coppin was made
      the &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; of the &ldquo;third expedition,&rdquo; which left the ship in the shallop,
      Wednesday, December 6, and, after varying disasters and a narrow escape
      from shipwreck&mdash;through Coppin&rsquo;s mistake&mdash;landed Friday night
      after dark, in the storm, on the island previously mentioned, ever since
      called &ldquo;Clarke&rsquo;s Island,&rdquo; at the mouth of Plymouth harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing further is known of Coppin except that he returned to England with
      the ship. He has passed into history only as Robert Coppin, &ldquo;the second
      mate&rdquo; (or &ldquo;pilot&rdquo;) of the MAY-FLOWER.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one other officer in merchant ships of the MAY-FLOWER class in her day
      was dignified by the address of &ldquo;Master&rdquo; (or Mister), or had rank with the
      Captain and Mates as a quarter-deck officer,&mdash;except in those
      instances where a surgeon or a chaplain was carried. That the MAY-FLOWER
      carried no special ship&rsquo;s-surgeon has been supposed from the fact of Dr.
      Fuller&rsquo;s attendance alike on her passengers and crew, and the increased
      mortality of the seamen&mdash;after his removal on shore.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [The author is greatly indebted to his esteemed friend, Mr. George
     Ernest Bowman, Secretary-General of the Society of MAY-FLOWER
     Descendants, for information of much value upon this point. He
     believes that he has discovered trustworthy evidence of the
     existence of a small volume bearing upon its title-page an
     inscription that would certainly indicate that the MAY-FLOWER had
     her own surgeon. A copy of the inscription, which Mr. Bowman
     declares well attested (the book not being within reach), reads as
     follows:&mdash;



               &ldquo;To Giles Heale Chirurgeon,
                         from Isaac Allerton
                                   in Virginia.
          Feb. 10, 1620.&rdquo;

     Giles Heale&rsquo;s name will be recognized as that of one of the
     witnesses to John Carver&rsquo;s copy of William Mullens&rsquo;s nuncupative
     will, and, if he was the ship&rsquo;s-surgeon, might very naturally appear
     in that relation.  If book and inscription exist and the latter is
     genuine, it would be indubitable proof that Heale (who was surely
     not a MAY-FLOWER passenger) was one of the ship&rsquo;s company, and if a
     &ldquo;chirurgeon,&rdquo; the surgeon of the ship, for no other Englishmen,
     except those of the colonists and the ship&rsquo;s company, could have
     been at New Plymouth, at the date given, and New England was then
     included in the term &ldquo;Virginia.&rdquo;  It is much to be hoped that Mr.
     Bowman&rsquo;s belief may be established, and that in Giles Heale we shall
     have another known officer, the surgeon, of the MAY-FLOWER.]


</pre>
    <p>
      That she had no chaplain goes without saying. The Pilgrims had their
      spiritual adviser with them in the person of Elder Brewster, and were not
      likely to tolerate a priest of either the English or the Romish church on
      a vessel carrying them. The officer referred to was the representative of
      the business interests of the owner or chartering-party, on whose account
      the ship made the voyage; and in that day was known as the
      &ldquo;ship&rsquo;s-merchant,&rdquo; later as the &ldquo;purser,&rdquo; and in some relations as the
      &ldquo;supercargo.&rdquo; No mention of an officer thus designated, belonging to the
      MAY-FLOWER, has ever been made by any writer, so far as known, and it
      devolves upon the author to indicate his existence and to establish, so
      far as possible, both this and his identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain &ldquo;Master Williamson,&rdquo; whose name and presence, though but once
      mentioned by Governor Bradford, have greatly puzzled Pilgrim historians,
      seems to have filled this berth on board the MAY-FLOWER. Bradford tells us
      that on Thursday, March 22, 1620/21, &ldquo;Master Williamson&rdquo; was designated to
      accompany Captain Standish&mdash;practically as an officer of the guard&mdash;to
      receive and escort the Pokanoket chief, Massasoit, to Governor Carver, on
      the occasion of the former&rsquo;s first visit of state. Prior to the recent
      discovery in London, by an American genealogist, of a copy of the
      nuncupative will of Master William Mullens, one of the MAY-FLOWER
      Pilgrims, clearly dictated to Governor John Carver on board the ship, in
      the harbor of New Plymouth (probably) Wednesday, February 21, 1620 (though
      not written out by Carver till April 2, 1620), on which day (as we learn
      from Bradford), Master Mullens died, no other mention of &ldquo;Master
      Williamson&rdquo; than that above quoted was known, and his very existence was
      seriously questioned. In this will, as elsewhere noted, &ldquo;Master
      Williamson&rdquo; is named as one of the &ldquo;Overseers.&rdquo; By most early writers it
      was held that Bradford had unwittingly substituted the name &ldquo;Williamson&rdquo;
       for that of Allerton, and this view&mdash;apparently for no better reasons
      than that both names had two terminal letters in common, and that Allerton
      was associated next day with Standish on some military duty&mdash;came to
      be generally accepted, and Allerton&rsquo;s name to be even frequently
      substituted without question.&mdash;-Miss Marcia A. Thomas, in her
      &ldquo;Memorials of Marshfield&rdquo; (p. 75), says: &ldquo;In 1621, Master Williamson,
      Captain Standish, and Edward Winslow made a journey to make a treaty with
      Massasoit. He is called &lsquo;Master George,&rsquo; meaning probably Master George
      Williamson,&rdquo; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is certainly most absurd, and by one not familiar with the
      exceptional fidelity and the conscientious work of Miss Thomas would
      rightly be denounced as reckless and reprehensible fabrication. Of course
      Williamson, Standish, and Winslow made no such journey, and made no treaty
      with Massasoit, but aided simply in conducting, with due ceremonial, the
      first meeting between Governor John Carver and the Indian sachem at
      Plymouth, at which a treaty was concluded. There is no historical warrant
      whatever for the name of &ldquo;George,&rdquo; as appertaining to &ldquo;Master William
      son.&rdquo; The fact, however,&mdash;made known by the fortunate discovery
      mentioned,&mdash;that &ldquo;Master Williamson&rdquo; was named in his will by Master
      Mullens as one of its &ldquo;Overseers,&rdquo; and undoubtedly probated the will in
      England, puts the existence of such a person beyond reasonable doubt. That
      he was a person of some dignity, and of very respectable position, is
      shown by the facts that he was chosen as Standish&rsquo;s associate, as
      lieutenant of the guard, on an occasion of so much importance, and was
      thought fit by Master Mullens, a careful and clear-headed man as his will
      proves,&mdash;to be named an &ldquo;Overseer&rdquo; of that will, charged with
      responsible duties to Mullens&rsquo;s children and property. It is practically
      certain that on either of the above-mentioned dates (February 21, or March
      22) there were no human beings in the Colony of New Plymouth beside the
      passengers of the MAY-FLOWER, her officers and crew, and the native
      savages. Visitors, by way of the fishing vessels on the Maine coast, had
      not yet begun to come, as they did a little later. It is certain that no
      one of the name of &ldquo;Williamson&rdquo; was among the colonist passengers, or
      indeed for several years in the colony, and we may at once dismiss both
      the passengers and the savages from our consideration. This elimination
      renders it inevitable that &ldquo;Master Williamson&rdquo; must have been of the
      ship&rsquo;s company. It remains to determine, if possible, what position upon
      the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S roster he presumably held. His selection by &ldquo;Master&rdquo;
       Mullens as one of the &ldquo;Over seers&rdquo; of his will suggests the probability
      that, having named Governor Carver as the one upon whom he would rely for
      the care of his family and affairs in New England, Mr. Mullens sought as
      the other a proper person, soon to return to England, and hence able to
      exercise like personal interest in his two children and his considerable
      property left there? Such a suggestion points to a returning and competent
      officer of the ship. That &ldquo;Master Williamson&rdquo; was above the grade of
      &ldquo;petty officer,&rdquo; and ranked at least with the mates or &ldquo;pilots,&rdquo; is clear
      from the fact that he is invariably styled &ldquo;Master&rdquo; (equivalent to
      Mister), and we know with certainty that he was neither captain nor mate.
      That he was a man of address and courage follows the fact that he was
      chosen by Standish as his lieutenant, while the choice in and of itself is
      a strong bit of presumptive proof that he held the position on the
      MAY-FLOWER to which he is here assigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only officer commonly carried by a ship of the MAY-FLOWER class, whose
      rank, capacities, and functions would comport with every fact and feature
      of the case, was &ldquo;the ship&rsquo;s-merchant,&rdquo; her accountant, factor, and
      usually&mdash;when such was requisite&mdash;her &ldquo;interpreter,&rdquo; on every
      considerable (trading) voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is altogether probable that it was in his capacity of &ldquo;interpreter&rdquo; (as
      Samoset and Tisquantum knew but little English), and on account of what
      knowledge of the Indian tongue he very probably possessed, that Standish
      chose Williamson as his associate for the formal reception of Massasoit.
      It is indeed altogether probable that it was this familiarity with the
      &ldquo;trade lingo&rdquo; of the American coast tribes which influenced &mdash;perhaps
      determined&mdash;his employment as &ldquo;ship&rsquo;s-merchant&rdquo; of the MAY-FLOWER for
      her Pilgrim voyage, especially as she was expected to &ldquo;load back&rdquo; for
      England with the products of the country, only to be had by barter with
      the Indians. It is evident that there must naturally have been some
      provision made for communication with the natives, for the purposes of
      that trade, etc., which the Planters hoped to establish. Trading along the
      northern coast of Virginia (as the whole coast strip was then called),
      principally for furs, had been carried on pretty actively, since 1584, by
      such navigators as Raleigh&rsquo;s captains, Gosnold, Pring, Champlain, Smith,
      Dermer, Hunt, and the French and Dutch, and much of the &ldquo;trade lingo&rdquo; of
      the native tribes had doubtless been &ldquo;picked up&rdquo; by their different
      &ldquo;ship&rsquo;s-merchants.&rdquo; It appears by Bradford&rsquo; that Dermer, when coasting the
      shores of New England, in Sir Ferdinando Gorges&rsquo;s employ, brought the
      Indian Tisquantum with him, from England, as his interpreter, and
      doubtless from him Dermer and other ship&rsquo;s officers &ldquo;picked up&rdquo; more or
      less Indian phrases, as Tisquantum (Squanto) evidently did of English.
      Winslow, in his &ldquo;Good Newes from New England,&rdquo; written in 1622, says of
      the Indian tongue, as spoken by the tribes about them at Plymouth, &ldquo;it is
      very copious, large, and difficult. As yet we cannot attain to any great
      measure thereof, but can understand them, and explain ourselves to their
      understanding, by the help of those that daily converse with us.&rdquo; This
      being the case, after two years of constant communication, and noting how
      trivial knowledge of English speech Samoset and Tisquantum had, it is easy
      to understand that, if Williamson had any knowledge of the native tongue,
      Standish would be most anxious to have the benefit of it, in this prime
      and all-important effort at securing a permanent alliance with the ruling
      sachem of the region. Bradford, in &ldquo;Mourt&rsquo;s Relation,&rdquo; speaking of the
      speech of Governor Carver to Massasoit, says: &ldquo;He [Massasoit] liked well
      of the speech and heard it attentively, though the interpreters did not
      well express it.&rdquo; Probably all three, Tisquantum, Samoset, and Williamson,
      had a voice in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That &ldquo;Master Williamson&rdquo; was a veritable person at New Plymouth, in
      February and March, 1620/21, is now beyond dispute; that he must have been
      of the ship&rsquo;s company of the MAY-FLOWER is logically certain; that he was
      one of her officers, and a man of character, is proven by his title of
      &ldquo;Master&rdquo; and his choice by Standish and Mullens for exceptional and
      honorable service; that the position of &ldquo;ship&rsquo;s-merchant&rdquo; alone answers to
      the conditions precedent, is evident; and that such an officer was
      commonly carried by ships of the MAY-FLOWER class on such voyages as hers
      is indicated by the necessity, and proven by the facts known as to other
      ships on similar New England voyages, both earlier and later. The fact
      that he was called simply &ldquo;Master Williamson,&rdquo; in both cases where he is
      mentioned, with out other designation or identification, is highly
      significant, and clearly indicates that he was some one so familiarly
      known to all concerned that no occasion for any further designation
      apparently occurred to the minds of Mullens, Carver, or Bradford, when
      referring to him. In the case of Master John Hampden, the only other
      notable incognito of early Pilgrim literature, the description is full,
      and the only question concerning him has been of his identity with John
      Hampden, the English patriot of the Cromwellian era. It is, therefore, not
      too much to assert that the MAY-FLOWER carried a &ldquo;ship&rsquo;s-merchant&rdquo; (or
      purser), and that &ldquo;Master Williamson&rdquo; was that officer. If close-linked
      circumstantial evidence is ever to be relied upon, it clearly establishes
      in this case the identity of the &ldquo;Master Williamson&rdquo; who was Governor
      Bradford&rsquo;s incognito, and the person of the same name mentioned a month
      earlier in &ldquo;Master&rdquo; Mullens&rsquo;s will; as also the fact that in him we have a
      new officer of the MAY FLOWER, hitherto unknown as such to Pilgrim
      literature. If Mr. Bowman&rsquo;s belief as to Giles Heale (see note) proves
      correct, we have yet another, the Surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Carpenter, Gunner, Boatswain, Quartermaster, and &ldquo;Masters-mates&rdquo; are
      the only &ldquo;petty officers&rdquo; of the Pilgrim ship of whom any record makes
      mention. The carpenter is named several times, and was evidently, as might
      be expected, one of the most useful men of the ship&rsquo;s crew. Called into
      requisition, doubtless, in the conferences as to the condition of the
      SPEEDWELL, on both of her returns to port, at the inception of the voyage,
      he was especially in evidence when, in mid-ocean, &ldquo;the cracking and
      bending of a great deck-beam,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;shaken&rdquo; condition of &ldquo;the upper
      works&rdquo; of the MAY-FLOWER, gave rise to much alarm, and it was by his
      labors and devices, and the use of the now famous &ldquo;jack-screw,&rdquo; that the
      bending beam and leaking deck were made secure. The repairs upon the
      shallop in Cape Cod harbor also devolved upon him, and mention is made of
      his illness and the dependence placed upon him. No doubt, in the
      construction of the first dwellings and of the ordnance platform on the
      hill, etc., he was the devising and principal workman. He undoubtedly
      returned to England with the ship, and is known in history only by his
      &ldquo;billet,&rdquo; as &ldquo;the carpenter&rdquo; of the MAY-FLOWER.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Master Gunner seems to have been a man with a proclivity for Indian
      barter, that led him to seek a place with the &ldquo;third expedition&rdquo; at Cape
      Cod, thereby nearly accomplishing his death, which indeed occurred later,
      in Plymouth harbor, not long before the return of the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boatswain is known, by Bradford&rsquo;s records, to have died in the general
      sickness which attacked the crew while lying in Plymouth harbor. The brief
      narrative of his sickness and death is all that we know of his
      personality. The writer says: &ldquo;He was a proud young man, and would often
      curse and scoff at the passengers,&rdquo; but being nursed when dying, by those
      of them who remained aboard, after his shipmates had deserted him in their
      craven fear of infection, &ldquo;he bewailed his former conduct,&rdquo; saying, &ldquo;Oh!
      you, I now see, show your love like Christians indeed, one to another, but
      we let one another lie and die like dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Four Quartermasters are mentioned (probably helmsmen simply), of whom
      three are known to have died in Plymouth harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Masters-mates&rdquo; are several times mentioned, but it is pretty certain that
      the &ldquo;pilots&rdquo; (or mates) are intended. Bradford and Winslow, in &ldquo;Mourt&rsquo;s
      Relation,&rdquo; say of the reappearance of the Indians: &ldquo;So Captain Standish,
      with another [Hopkins], with their muskets, went over to them, with two of
      the masters-mates that follow them without [side?] arms, having two
      muskets with them: Who these &ldquo;masters-mates&rdquo; were does not appear.&rdquo; The
      language, &ldquo;two of the masters-mates,&rdquo; would possibly suggest that there
      were more of them. It hardly seems probable that both the mates of the
      MAY-FLOWER would thus volunteer, or thrust themselves forward in such a
      matter, and it seems doubtful if they would have been permitted (even if
      both ashore at one time, which, though unusual, did occur), to assume such
      duty. Whoever they were, they did not lack courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The names of the petty officers and seamen of the MAY-FLOWER do not appear
      as such, but the discovery of the (evidently) nuncupative will of William
      Mullens&mdash;herein referred to&mdash;has perhaps given us two of them.
      Attached to John Carver&rsquo;s certificate of the particulars of this will,
      filed at Somerset House, London, are the names, &ldquo;Giles Heale&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Christopher Joanes.&rdquo; As Mr Mullens died Wednesday, February 21, 1620, on
      board the MAY-FLOWER in Plymouth harbor, on which day we know from
      Bradford&rsquo; that &ldquo;the Master [Jones, whose name was Thomas] came on shore
      with many of his sailors,&rdquo; to land and mount the cannon on the fort, and
      as they had a full day&rsquo;s work to draw up the hill and mount five guns, and
      moreover brought the materials for, and stayed to eat, a considerable
      dinner with the Pilgrims, they were doubtless ashore all day. It is
      rational to interpret the known facts to indicate that in this absence of
      the Captain and most of his crew ashore, Mr. Mullens, finding himself
      failing fast, sent for Governor Carver and&mdash;unable to do more than
      speak &mdash;dictated to him the disposition of his property which he
      desired to make. Carver, noting this down from his dictation, undoubtedly
      called in two of the ship&rsquo;s company (Heale very likely being the
      ship&rsquo;s-surgeon), who were left aboard to &ldquo;keep ship,&rdquo; to hear his notes
      read to Mullens and assented to by him, they thus becoming the witnesses
      to his will, to the full copy of which, as made by Carver (April 2), they
      affixed their names as such. As there were then at Plymouth (besides
      savages) only the passengers and crew of the MAY-FLOWER, and these men
      were certainly not among the passengers, it seems inevitable that they
      were of the crew. That &ldquo;Christopher Joanes&rdquo; was not the Master of the ship
      is clear, because Heale&rsquo;s is the first signature, and no man of the crew
      would have dared to sign before the Captain; because the Captain&rsquo;s name
      was (as demonstrated) Thomas; and because we know that he was ashore all
      that day, with most of his men. It is by no means improbable that Captain
      Jones had shipped one of his kinsmen in his crew, possibly as one of the
      &ldquo;masters mates&rdquo; or quartermasters referred to (and it is by no means
      certain that there were not more than two), though these witnesses may
      have been quartermasters or other petty officers left on board as
      &ldquo;ship-keepers.&rdquo; Certain it is that these two witnesses must have been of
      the crew, and that &ldquo;Christopher Joanes&rdquo; was not the Captain, while it is
      equally sure, from the collateral evidence, that Master Mullens died on
      shipboard. Had he died on shore it is very certain that some of the
      leaders, Brewster, Bradford, or others, would have been witnesses, with
      such of the ship&rsquo;s officers as could aid in proving the will in England.
      It is equally evident that the officers of the ship were absent when
      Master Mullens dictated his will, except perhaps the surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of seamen belonging to the ship is nowhere definitely stated.
      At least four in the employ of the Pilgrims were among the passengers and
      not enrolled upon the ships&rsquo; lists. From the size of the ship, the amount
      of sail she probably carried, the weight of her anchors, and certain other
      data which appear,&mdash;such as the number allowed to leave the ship at a
      time, etc.,&mdash;it is probably not a wild estimate to place their number
      at from twenty to twenty-five. This is perhaps a somewhat larger number
      than would be essential to work the ship, and than would have been shipped
      if the voyage had been to any port of a civilized country; but on a voyage
      to a wild coast, the possibilities of long absence and of the weakening of
      the crew by death, illness, etc., demanded consideration and a larger
      number. The wisdom and necessity of carrying, on a voyage to an
      uninhabited country, some spare men, is proven by the record of Bradford,
      who says: &ldquo;The disease begane to fall amongst them the seamen also, so as
      allmost halfe of their company dyed before they went away and many of
      their officers and lustyest men; as ye boatson, gunner, 3 quarter
      maisters, the cooke, and others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The LADY ARBELLA, the &ldquo;Admiral&rdquo; of Governor Winthrop&rsquo;s fleet, a ship of
      350 tons, carried 52 men, and it is a fair inference that the MAY-FLOWER,
      of a little more than half her tonnage, would require at least half as
      many. It is, therefore, not unlikely that the officers and crew of the
      MAY-FLOWER, all told, mustered thirty men, irrespective of the sailors,
      four in number (Alderton, English, Trevore, and Ely), in the Pilgrims&rsquo;
      employ.

    <h3>
      THE MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S PASSENGERS
    </h3>
    <p>
      The passenger list of the SPEEDWELL has given us the names of the Leyden
      members of the company which, with the cooperation of the associated
      Merchant Adventurers, was, in the summer of 1620, about to emigrate to
      America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it is not possible, with present knowledge, positively to determine
      every one of those who were passengers in the MAY-FLOWER from London to
      Southampton, most of them can be named with certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arranged for convenience, so far as possible, by families, they were:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Master Robert Cushman, the London agent of the Leyden company,
     Mrs. Mary (Clarke)-Singleton Cushman, 2d wife,
     Thomas Cushman, son (by 1st wife).
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Master Christopher Martin, treasurer-agent of the colonists,
     Mrs. Martin, wife,
     Solomon Prower, &ldquo;servant,&rdquo;
      John Langemore, &ldquo;servant.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Master Richard Warren.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
Master William Mullens,
     Mrs. Alice Mullens, wife,

     Priscilla Mullens, 2d daughter,
     Robert Carter, &ldquo;servant.&rdquo;

Master Stephen Hopkins,
     Mrs. Elizabeth (Fisher?) Hopkins, 2d wife,
     Giles Hopkins, son (by former wife),
     Constance Hopkins, daughter (by former wife),
     Damaris Hopkins, daughter,
     Edward Dotey, &ldquo;servant,&rdquo;
      Edward Leister, &ldquo;servant.&rdquo;

     Mrs. Susanna (2) Chilton, wife,
     Mary Chilton, daughter.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Richard Gardiner.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Billington,
     Mrs. Eleanor (or Helen) Billington, wife,
     John Billington (Jr.), son,
     Francis Billington, son.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    William Latham, &ldquo;servant-boy&rdquo; to Deacon Carver.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Jasper More, &ldquo;bound-boy&rdquo; to Deacon Carver.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Ellen More, &ldquo;little bound girl&rdquo; to Master Edward Winslow.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Richard More, &ldquo;bound-boy&rdquo; to Elder Brewster.
    &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- More, &ldquo;bound-boy&rdquo; to Elder Brewster.
</pre>
    <p>
      There is a possibility that Thomas Rogers and his son, Joseph, who are
      usually accredited to the Leyden company, were of the London contingent,
      and sailed from there, though this is contra-indicated by certain
      collateral data.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible, also, of course, that any one or more of the English
      colonists (with a few exceptions&mdash;such as Cushman and family, Mullens
      and family, the More children and others&mdash;known to have left London
      on the MAY-FLOWER) might have joined her (as did Carver and Alden, perhaps
      Martin and family) at Southampton, but the strong presumption is that most
      of the English passengers joined the ship at London.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is just possible, too, that the seamen, Alderton (or Allerton),
      English, Trevore, and Ely, were hired in London and were on board the
      MAY-FLOWER when she left that port, though they might have been employed
      and joined the ship at either Southampton, Dartmouth, or Plymouth. It is
      strongly probable, however, that they were part, if not all, hired in
      Holland, and came over to Southampton in the pinnace.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Robert Cushman&mdash;the London agent (for more than three years) of the
     Leyden congregation, and, in spite of the wickedly unjust criticism
     of Robinson and others, incompetent to judge his acts, their brave,
     sagacious, and faithful servant&mdash;properly heads the list.

     Bradford says: &ldquo;Where they find the bigger ship come from London,
     Mr. Jones, Master, with the rest of the company who had been waiting
     there with Mr. Cushman seven days.&rdquo;  Deacon Carver, probably from
     being on shore, was not here named.  In a note appended to the
     memoir of Robert Cushman (prefatory to his Discourse delivered at
     Plymouth, New England, on &ldquo;The Sin and Danger of Self-Love&rdquo;) it is
     stated in terms as follows: &ldquo;The fact is, that Mr. Cushman procured
     the larger vessel, the MAY-FLOWER, and its pilot, at London, and
     left in that vessel.&rdquo; The statement&mdash;though published long after the
     events of which it treats and by other than Mr. Cushman&mdash;we know to
     be substantially correct, and the presumption is that the writer,
     whoever he may have been, knew also.

     Sailing with his wife and son (it is not probable that he had any
     other living child at the time), in full expectation that it was for
     Virginia, he encountered so much of ungrateful and abusive
     treatment, after the brethren met at Southampton,&mdash;especially at the
     hands of the insufferable Martin, who, without merit and with a most
     reprehensible record (as it proved), was chosen over him as
     &ldquo;governor&rdquo; of the ship,&mdash;that he was doubtless glad to return from
     Plymouth when the SPEEDWELL broke down.  He and his family appear,
     therefore, as &ldquo;MAY-FLOWER passengers,&rdquo; only between London and
     Plymouth during the vexatious attendance upon the scoundrelly Master
     of the SPEEDWELL, in his &ldquo;doublings&rdquo; in the English Channel.  His
     Dartmouth letter to Edward Southworth, one of the most valuable
     contributions to the early literature of the Pilgrims extant,
     clearly demonstrates that he was suffering severely from dyspepsia
     and deeply wounded feelings.  The course of events was his complete
     vindication, and impartial history to-day pronounces him second to
     none in his service to the Pilgrims and their undertaking.  His
     first wife is shown by Leyden records to have been Sarah Reder, and
     his second marriage to have occurred May 19/June 3, 1617, [sic]
     about the time he first went to England in behalf of the Leyden
     congregation.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Mrs. Mary (Clarke)-Singleton Cushman appears only as a passenger of the
     MAY-FLOWER on her channel voyage, as she returned with her husband
     and son from Plymouth, England, in the SPEEDWELL.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Thomas Cushman, it is quite clear, must have been a son by a former wife,
     as he would have been but a babe, if the son of the latest wife,
     when he went to New England with his father, in the FORTUNE, to
     remain. Goodwin and others give his age as fourteen at this time,
     and his age at death is their warrant.  Robert Cushman died in 1625,
     but a &ldquo;Mary, wife [widow?] of Robert Cushman, and their son,
     Thomas,&rdquo; seem to have been remembered in the will of Ellen Bigge,
     widow, of Cranbrooke, England, proved February 12, 1638
     (Archdeaconry, Canterbury, vol. lxx.  leaf 482).  The will intimates
     that the &ldquo;Thomas&rdquo; named was &ldquo;under age&rdquo; when the bequest was made.
     If this is unmistakably so (though there is room for doubt), then
     this was not the Thomas of the Pilgrims.  Otherwise the evidence is
     convincing.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Master Christopher Martin, who was made, Bradford informs us, the
     treasurer-agent of the Planter Company, Presumably about the time of
     the original conclusions between the Adventurers and the Planters,
     seems to have been appointed such, as Bradford states, not because
     he was needed, but to give the English contingent of the Planter
     body representation in the management, and to allay thereby any
     suspicion or jealousy.  He was, if we are to judge by the evidence
     in hand concerning his contention and that of his family with the
     Archdeacon, the strong testimony that Cushman bears against him in
     his Dartmouth letter of August 17, and the fact that there seems to
     have been early dissatisfaction with him as &ldquo;governor&rdquo; on the ship,
     a very self-sufficient, somewhat arrogant, and decidedly contentious
     individual.  His selection as treasurer seems to have been very
     unfortunate, as Bradford indicates that his accounts were in
     unsatisfactory shape, and that he had no means of his own, while his
     rather surprising selection for the office of &ldquo;governor&rdquo; of the
     larger ship, after the unpleasant experience with him as
     treasurer-agent, is difficult to account for, except that he was
     evidently an active opponent of Cushman, and the latter was just
     then in disfavor with the colonists. He was evidently a man in the
     prime of life, an &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; who had the courage of his
     convictions if little discretion, and much of that energy and
     self-reliance which, properly restrained, are excellent elements
     for a colonist.  Very little beside the fact that he came from
     Essex is known of him, and nothing of his wife.  He has further
     mention hereafter.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Solomon Prower is clearly shown by the complaint made against him by the
     Archdeacon of Chelmsford, the March before he sailed on the
     MAY-FLOWER, to  have been quite a youth, a firm &ldquo;Separatist,&rdquo; and
     something more than an ordinary &ldquo;servant.&rdquo;  He seems to have been
     summoned before the Archdeacon at the same time with young Martin
     (a son of Christopher), and this fact suggests some nearer relation
     than that of &ldquo;servant.&rdquo;  He is sometimes spoken of as Martin&rsquo;s
     &ldquo;son,&rdquo; by what warrant does not appear, but the fact suggests that
     he may have been a step-son.  Bradford, in recording his death,
     says: &ldquo;Dec. 24, this day dies Solomon Martin.&rdquo;  This could, of
     course, have been none other than Solomon Prower.  Dr. Young, in his
     &ldquo;Chronicles,&rdquo; speaking of Martin, says, &ldquo;he brought his wife and two
     children.&rdquo;  If this means Martin&rsquo;s children, it is evidently an
     error.  It may refer to age only.  His case is puzzling, for
     Bradford makes him both &ldquo;servant&rdquo; and &ldquo;son.&rdquo;  If of sufficient age
     and account to be cited before the Archdeacon for discipline, it
     seems strange that he should not have signed the &ldquo;Compact.&rdquo;  Even if
     a &ldquo;servant&rdquo; this would seem to have been no bar, as Dotey and
     Leister were certainly such, yet signers. The indications are that
     he was but a well-grown lad, and that his youth, or severe illness,
     and not his station, accounts for the absence of his signature.  If
     a young foster-son or kinsman of Martin, as seems most likely, then
     Martin&rsquo;s signature was sufficient, as in the cases of fathers for
     their sons; if really a &ldquo;ser vant&rdquo; then too young (like Latham and
     Hooke) to be called upon, as were Dotey and Leister.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Langemore; there is nothing (save the errors of Dr. Young) to
     indicate that he was other than a &ldquo;servant.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Richard Warren was probably from Kent or Essex.  Surprisingly little is
     known of his antecedents, former occupation, etc.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
William Mullens and his family were, as shown, from Dorking in Surrey,
     and their home was therefore close to London, whence they sailed,
     beyond doubt, in the MAY-FLOWER.  The discovery at Somerset House,
     London, by Mr. Henry F. Waters, of Salem, Massachusetts; of what is
     evidently the nuncupative will of William Mullens, proves an
     important one in many particulars, only one of which need be
     referred to in this connection, but all of which will receive due
     consideration.  It conclusively shows Mr. Mullens not to have been
     of the Leyden congregation, as has sometimes been claimed, but that
     he was a well-to-do tradesman of Dorking in Surrey, adjacent to
     London.  It renders it certain, too, that he had been some time
     resident there, and had both a married daughter and a son (William),
     doubtless living there, which effectually overthrows the &ldquo;imaginary
     history&rdquo; of Baird, and of that pretty story, &ldquo;Standish of Standish,&rdquo;
      whereby the Mullens (or Molines) family are given French (Huguenot)
     antecedents and the daughter is endowed with numerous airs, graces,
     and accomplishments, professedly French.

     Dr. Griffis, in his delightful little narrative, &ldquo;The Pilgrims in
     their Three Homes, England, Holland, America,&rdquo; cites the name
     &ldquo;Mullins&rdquo; as a Dutch distortion of Molines or Molineaux.  Without
     questioning that such it might be,&mdash;for the Dutch scribes were
     gifted in remarkable distortions of simple names, even of their own
     people,&mdash;they evidently had no hand in thus maltreating the patronym
     of William Mullens (or Mullins) of the Pilgrims, for not only is
     evidence entirely wanting to show that he was ever a Leyden citizen,
     though made such by the fertile fiction of Mrs. Austin, but Governor
     Carver, who knew him well, wrote it in his will &ldquo;Mullens,&rdquo; while two
     English probate functionaries of his own home-counties wrote it
     respectively &ldquo;Mullens&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mullins.&rdquo;

     Dr. Grifs speaks of &ldquo;the Mullens family&rdquo; as evidently [sic] of
     Huguenot or Walloon birth or descent, but in doing so probably knew
     no other authority than Mrs. Austin&rsquo;s little novel, or (possibly)
     Dr. Baird&rsquo;s misstatements.

     A writer in the &ldquo;New England Historic-Genealogical Register,&rdquo; vol.
     xlvii, p. 90, states, that &ldquo;Mrs. Jane G. Austin found her authority
     for saying that Priscilla Mullens was of a Huguenot family, in Dr.
     Baird&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of Huguenot Emigration to America,&rsquo; vol. i.
     p. 158,&rdquo; etc., referring to Rev. Charles W. Baird, D. D., New York.
     The reference given is a notable specimen of very bad historical
     work.  Of Dr. Baird, one has a right to expect better things, and
     the positiveness of his reckless assertion might well mislead those
     not wholly familiar with the facts involved, as it evidently has
     more than one.  He states, without qualification or reservation,
     that &ldquo;among the passengers in the SPEEDWELL were several of the
     French who had decided to cast in their lot with these English
     brethren.  William Molines and his daughter Priscilla, afterwards
     the wife of John Alden and Philip Delanoy, born in Leyden of French
     parents, were of the number.&rdquo;  One stands confounded by such a
     combination of unwarranted errors.  Not only is it not true that
     there &ldquo;were several of the French among the passengers in the
     SPEEDWELL,&rdquo; but there is no evidence whatever that there was even
     one.  Those specifically named as there, certainly were not, and
     there is not the remotest proof or reason to believe, that William
     Mullens (or Molines) and his daughter Priscilla (to say nothing of
     the wife and son who accompanied him to America, whom Baird forgets)
     ever even saw Leyden or Delfshaven.  Their home had been at Dorking
     in Surrey, just across the river from London, whence the MAY-FLOWER
     sailed for New England, and nothing could be more absurd than to
     assume that they were passengers on the SPEEDWELL from Delfshaven to
     Southampton.

     So far from Philip Delanoy (De La Noye or Delano) being a passenger
     on the SPEEDWELL, he was not even one of the Pilgrim company, did
     not go to New England till the following year (in the FORTUNE), and
     of course had no relation to the SPEEDWELL.  Neither does Edward
     Winslow&mdash;the only authority for the parentage of &ldquo;Delanoy&rdquo;&mdash;state
     that &ldquo;he was born in Leyden,&rdquo; as Baird alleges, but only that &ldquo;he
     was born of French parents .  .  .  and came to us from Leyden to
     New Plymouth,&rdquo;&mdash;an essential variance in several important
     particulars. Scores and perhaps hundreds of people have been led to
     believe Priscilla Mullens a French Protestant of the Leyden
     congregation, and themselves&mdash;as her descendants&mdash;&ldquo;of Huguenot
     stock,&rdquo; because of these absolutely groundless assertions of Dr.
     Baird. They lent themselves readily to Mrs. Austin&rsquo;s fertile
     imagination and facile pen, and as &ldquo;welcome lies&rdquo; acquired a hold on
     the public mind, from which even the demonstrated truth will never
     wholly dislodge them.  The comment of the intelligent writer in the
     &ldquo;Historic-Genealogical Register&rdquo; referred to is proof of this.  So
     fast-rooted had these assertions become in her thought as the truth,
     that, confronted with the evidence that Master Mullens and his
     family were from Dorking in England, it does not occur to her to
     doubt the correctness of the impression which the recklessness of
     Baird had created,&mdash;that they were of Leyden,&mdash;and she hence
     amusingly suggests that &ldquo;they must have moved from Leyden to
     Dorking.&rdquo;  These careless utterances of one who is especially bound
     by his position, both as a writer and as a teacher of morals, to be
     jealous for the truth, might be partly condoned as attributable to
     mistake or haste, except for the facts that they seem to have been
     the fountain-head of an ever-widening stream of serious error, and
     that they are preceded on the very page that bears them by others as
     to the Pilgrim exodus equally unhappy.  It seems proper to suggest
     that it is high time that all lovers of reliable history should
     stand firmly together against the flood of loose statement which is
     deluging the public; brand the false wherever found; and call for
     proof from of all new and important historical propositions put
     forth.

Stephen Hopkins may possibly have had more than one wife before
     Elizabeth, who accompanied him to New England and was mother of the
     sea-born son Oceanus.  Hopkins&rsquo;s will indicates his affection for
     this latest wife, in unusual degree for wills of that day.  With
     singular carelessness, both of the writer and his proof-reader, Hon.
     William T. Davis states that Damaris Hopkins was born &ldquo;after the
     arrival&rdquo; in New England.  The contrary is, of course, a well
     established fact.  Mr. Davis was probably led into this error by
     following Bradford&rsquo;s &ldquo;summary&rdquo; as affecting the Hopkins family.  He
     states therein that Hopkins &ldquo;had one son, who became a seaman and
     died at Barbadoes probably Caleb, and four daugh ters born here.&rdquo;
      To make up these &ldquo;four&rdquo; daughters &ldquo;born here&rdquo; Davis found it
     necessary to include Damaris, unmindful that Bradford names her in
     his list of MAY-FLOWER passengers.  It is evident, either that
     Bradford made a mistake in the number, or that there was some
     daughter who died in infancy.  It is evident that Dotey and Leister,
     the &ldquo;servants&rdquo; of Hopkins, were of English origin and accompanied
     their master from London.

Gilbert Winslow was a brother of Edward Winslow, a young man, said to
     have been a carpenter, who returned to England after &ldquo;divers years&rdquo;
      in New England.  There is a possibility that he was at Leyden and
     was a passenger on the SPEEDWELL.  It has been suggested that he
     spent the greater part of the time he was in New England, outside of
     the Pilgrim Colony.  He took no part in its affairs.

James Chilton and his family are but little known to Pilgrim writers,
     except the daughter Mary, who came into notice principally through
     her marriage with John Winslow, another brother of Governor Edward,
     who came over later.  Their name has assumed a singular prominence
     in popular regard, altogether disproportionate to either their
     personal characteristics, station, or the importance of their early
     descendants.  Some unaccountable glamour of romance, without any
     substantial foundation, is probably responsible for it.  They left a
     married daughter behind them in England, which is the only hint we
     have as to their home just prior to the embarkation.  There has been
     a disposition, not well grounded, to regard them as of Leyden.

John Billington and his family were unmistakably of the English
     colonists.  Mrs. Billington&rsquo;s name has been variously given,
     e.g.  Helen, Ellen, and Eleanor, and the same writer has used them
     interchangeably.  One writer has made the inexcusable error of
     stating that &ldquo;the younger son, Francis, was born after the arrival
     at New Plymouth,&rdquo; but his own affidavit shows him to have been born
     in 1606.

William Latham, a &ldquo;servant-boy&rdquo; of Deacon Carver, has always been of
     doubtful relation, some circumstances indicating that he was of
     Leyden and hence was a SPEEDWELL passenger, but others&mdash;and these
     the more significant&mdash;rendering it probable that he was an English
     boy, who was obtained in London (like the More children) and
     apprenticed to Carver, in which case he probably came in the
     MAY-FLOWER from London, though he may have awaited her coming with
     his master at Southampton, in which case he probably originally
     embarked there, with him, on the SPEEDWELL, and was transferred
     with him, at Plymouth, to the MAY-FLOWER.  There is, of course,
     also still the possibility that he came with Carver&rsquo;s family from
     Leyden.  Governor Carver&rsquo;s early death necessarily changed his
     status somewhat, and Plymouth early records do not give much beyond
     suggestion as to what the change was; but all indications confirm
     the opinion that he was a poor boy&mdash;very likely of London or
     vicinity&mdash;taken by Carver as his &ldquo;servant.&rdquo;

The More children, Jasper, Richard, their brother (whose given name has
     never transpired), and Ellen, their sister, invite more than passing
     mention.  The belief has always been current and confident among
     students of Pilgrim history that these More children, four in
     number, &ldquo;put&rdquo; or &ldquo;indentured&rdquo; to three of the Leyden leaders, were
     probably orphaned children of some family of the Leyden
     congregation, and were so &ldquo;bound&rdquo; to give them a chance in the new
     colony, in return for such services as they could render to those
     they accompanied.  If thus of the Leyden contingent they would,
     of course, be enumerated as passengers in the SPEEDWELL from
     Delfshaven, but if of the English contingent they should probably be
     borne on the list of passengers sailing from London in the
     MAY-FLOWER, certainly should be reckoned as part of the English
     contingent on the MAY-FLOWER at Southampton.  An affidavit of
     Richard More, perhaps the eldest of these children, indentured to
     Elder Brewster, dated in 1684., found in &ldquo;Proceedings of the
     Provincial Court, Maryland Archives, vol.  xiv.  (&lsquo;New England
     Historic-Genealogical Register,&rsquo; vol  1.  p. 203 ),&rdquo; affirms the
     deponent to be then &ldquo;seaventy years or thereabouts&rdquo; of age, which
     would have made him some six years of age, &ldquo;or thereabouts,&rdquo; in
     1620.  He deposes &ldquo;that being in London at the house of Mr. Thomas
     Weston, Iron monger, in the year 1620, he was from there transported
     to New Plymouth in New England,&rdquo; etc. This clearly identifies
     Richard More of the MAY FLOWER, and renders it well-nigh certain
     that he and his brothers and sister, &ldquo;bound out&rdquo; like himself to
     Pilgrim leaders, were of the English company, were probably never in
     Leyden or on the SPEEDWELL, and were very surely passengers on the
     MAY-FLOWER from London, in charge of Mr. Cushman or others.  The
     fact that the lad was in London, and went from thence direct to New
     England, is good evidence that he was not of the Leyden party.  The
     fair presump tion is that his brothers and sister were, like
     himself, of English birth, and humble&mdash;perhaps deceased&mdash;parents,
     taken because of their orphaned condition. It is highly improbable
     that they would be taken from London to Southampton by land, at the
     large expense of land travel in those days, when the MAY-FLOWER was
     to sail from London.  That they would accompany their respective
     masters to their respectively assigned ships at Southampton is
     altogether likely. The phraseology of his affidavit suggests the
     probability that Richard More, his brothers, and sister were brought
     to Mr. Weston&rsquo;s house, to be by him sent aboard the MAY-FLOWER,
     about to sail.  The affidavit is almost conclusive evidence as to
     the fact that the More children were all of the English colonists&rsquo;
     party, though apprenticed to Leyden families, and belonged to the
     London passenger list of the Pilgrim ship.  The researches of Dr.
     Neill among the MS. &ldquo;minutes&rdquo; and &ldquo;transactions&rdquo; of the (London)
     Virginia Company show germanely that, on November 17, 1619, &ldquo;the
     treasurer, council, and company&rdquo; of this Virginia Company addressed
     Sir William Cockaine, Knight, Lord Mayor of the city of London, and
     the right worthys the aldermen, his brethren, and the worthys the
     &ldquo;common council of the city,&rdquo; and  returning thanks for the benefits
     conferred, in furnishing out one hundred children this last year
     for &ldquo;the plantation in Virginia&rdquo; (from what Neill calls the
     &ldquo;homeless boys and girls of London&rdquo;), states, that, &ldquo;forasmuch as we
     have now resolved to send this next spring 1620 very large
     supplies,&rdquo; etc., &ldquo;we pray your Lordship and the rest .  .  .  to
     renew the like favors, and furnish us again with one hundred more
     for the next spring.  Our desire is that we may have them of twelve
     years old and upward, with allowance of L3 apiece for their
     transportation, and 40s. apiece for their apparel, as was formerly
     granted.  They shall be apprenticed; the boys till they come to 21
     years of age, the girls till like age or till they be married,&rdquo; etc.
     A letter of Sir Edwin Sandys (dated January 28, 1620) to Sir Robert
     Naunton shows that &ldquo;The city of London have appointed one hundred
     children from the superfluous multitude to be transported to
     Virginia, there to be bound apprentices upon very beneficial
     conditions.&rdquo;  In view of the facts that these More children&mdash;and
     perhaps others&mdash;were &ldquo;apprenticed&rdquo; or &ldquo;bound&rdquo; to the Pilgrims
     (Carver, Winslow, Brewster, etc.), and that there must have been
     some one to make the indentures, it seems strongly probable that
     these four children of one family,&mdash;as Bradford shows,&mdash;very likely
     orphaned, were among those designated by the city of London for the
     benefit of the (London) Virginia Company in the spring of 1620.
     They seem to have been waifs caught up in the westward-setting
     current, but only Richard survived the first winter.  Bradford,
     writing in 1650, states of Richard More that his brothers and sister
     died, &ldquo;but he is married 1636and hath 4 or 5 children.&rdquo;  William
     T. Davis, in his &ldquo;Ancient Landmarks of Plymouth&rdquo; (p. 24), states,
     and Arber copies him, that &ldquo;he was afterwards called Mann; and died
     at Scituate, New England, in 1656.&rdquo;  The researches of Mr. George E.
     Bowman, the able Secretary of the Massachusetts Society of
     MAY-FLOWER Descendants, some time since disproved this error,
     but Mores affidavit quoted conclusively determines the matter.

    <p>
      The possible accessions to the company, at London or Southampton, of Henry
      Sampson and Humility Cooper, cousins of Edward Tilley and wife, would be
      added to the passengers of the pinnace rather than to the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S,
      if, as seems probable, their relatives were of the SPEEDWELL. If Edward
      Tilley and his wife were assigned to the MAY FLOWER, room would doubtless
      also be found for these cousins on the ship. John Alden, the only
      positively known addition (except Carver) made to the list at Southampton,
      was, from the nature of his engagement as &ldquo;cooper,&rdquo; quite likely assigned
      to the larger ship. There are no known hints as to the assignments of
      passengers to the respective vessels at Southampton&mdash;then supposed to
      be final&mdash;beyond the remarks of Bradford that &ldquo;the chief [principal
      ones] of them that came from Leyden went on this ship [the SPEEDWELL] to
      give the Master content,&rdquo; and his further minute, that &ldquo;Master Martin was
      governour in the biger ship and Master Cushman assistante.&rdquo; It is very
      certain that Deacon Carver, one of the four agents of the colonists, who
      had &ldquo;fitted out&rdquo; the voyage in England, was a passenger in the SPEEDWELL
      from Southampton,&mdash;as the above mentioned remark of Bradford would
      suggest,&mdash;and was made &ldquo;governour&rdquo; of her passengers, as he later was
      of the whole company, on the MAY-FLOWER. It has sometimes been queried
      whether, in the interim between the arrival of the SPEEDWELL at
      Southampton and the assignment of the colonists to their respective ships
      (especially as both vessels were taking in and transferring cargo), the
      passengers remained on board or were quartered on shore. The same query
      has arisen, with even better reason, as to the passengers of the SPEEDWELL
      during the stay at Dartmouth, when the consort was being carefully
      overhauled to find her leaks, the suggestion being made that in this case
      some of them might have found accommodation on board the larger ship. The
      question may be fairly considered as settled negatively, from the facts
      that the colonists, with few exceptions, were unable to bear such extra
      expense themselves; the funds of the Adventurers&mdash;if any were on
      hand, which appears doubtful&mdash;were not available for the purpose;
      while the evidence of some of the early writers renders it very certain
      that the Leyden party were not released from residence on shipboard from
      the time they embarked on the SPEEDWELL at Delfshaven till the final
      landing in the harbor of New Plimoth. Just who of the Leyden chiefs caused
      themselves to be assigned to the smaller vessel, to encourage its cowardly
      Master, cannot be definitely known. It may be confidently assumed,
      however, that Dr. Samuel Fuller, the physician of the colonists, was
      transferred to the MAY-FLOWER, upon which were embarked three fourths of
      the entire company, including most of the women and children, with some of
      whom, it was evident, his services would be certainly in demand. There is
      little doubt that the good Elder (William Brewster) was also transferred
      to the larger ship at Southampton, while it would not be a very wild guess&mdash;in
      the light of Bradford&rsquo;s statement&mdash;to place Carver, Winslow,
      Bradford, Standish, Cooke, Howland, and Edward Tilley, and their families,
      among the passengers on the consort. Just how many passengers each vessel
      carried when they sailed from Southampton will probably never be
      positively known. Approximately, it may be said, on the authority of such
      contemporaneous evidence as is available, and such calculations as are
      possible from the data we have, that the SPEEDWELL had thirty (30), and
      the MAY-FLOWER her proportionate number, ninety (90)&mdash;a total of one
      hundred and twenty (120).

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Smith, New England&rsquo;s Trials, ed. 1622, London, p. 259.  It is a

     indicates by his words, &ldquo;the next day,&rdquo; and &ldquo;forced their return to

     he entirely omits the (first) return to Dartmouth, and numbers the

    <p>
      If the number one hundred and twenty (120) is correct, and the
      distribution suggested is also exact, viz. thirty (30) to the SPEEDWELL
      and ninety (90) to the MAY-FLOWER, it is clear that there must have been
      more than twelve (the number usually named) who went from the consort to
      the larger ship, when the pinnace was abandoned. We know that at least
      Robert Cushman and his family (wife and son), who were on the MAY-FLOWER,
      were among the number who returned to London upon the SPEEDWELL (and the
      language of Thomas Blossom in his letter to Governor Bradford, else where
      quoted, indicates that he and his son were also there), so that if the
      ship&rsquo;s number was ninety (90), and three or more were withdrawn, it would
      require fifteen (15) or more to make the number up to one hundred and two
      (102), the number of passengers we know the MAY-FLOWER had when she took
      her final departure. It is not likely we shall ever be able to determine
      exactly the names or number of those transferred to the MAY-FLOWER from
      the consort, or the number or names of all those who went back to London
      from either vessel. Several of the former and a few of the latter are
      known, but we must (except for some fortunate discovery) rest content with
      a very accurate knowledge of the passenger list of the MAY-FLOWER when she
      left Plymouth (England), and of the changes which occurred in it
      afterward; and a partial knowledge of the ship&rsquo;s own complement of
      officers and men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goodwin says: &ldquo;The returning ones were probably of those who joined in
      England, and had not yet acquired the Pilgrim spirit.&rdquo; Unhappily this view
      is not sustained by the relations of those of the number who are known.
      Robert Cushman and his family (3 persons), Thomas Blossom and his son (2
      persons), and William Ring (1 person), a total of six, or just one third
      of the putative eighteen who went back, all belonged to the Leyden
      congregation, and were far from lacking &ldquo;the Pilgrim spirit.&rdquo; Cushman was
      both ill and heart-sore from fatigue, disappointment, and bad treatment;
      Ring was very ill, according to Cushman&rsquo;s Dartmouth letter; but the
      motives governing Blossom and his son do not appear, unless the
      comparatively early death of the son&mdash;after which his father went to
      New England&mdash;furnishes a clue thereto. Bradford says: &ldquo;Those that
      went back were, for the most part, such as were willing to do so, either
      out of some discontent, or fear they conceived of the ill success of the
      Voyage, seeing so many crosses befallen and the year time so far spent.
      But others, in regard of their own weakness and the charge of many young
      children, were thought [by the Managers] least useful and most unfit to
      bear the brunt of this hard adventure.&rdquo; It is evident from the above that,
      while the return of most was from choice, some were sent back by those in
      authority, as unfit for the undertaking, and that of these some had &ldquo;many
      young chil dren.&rdquo; There are said to have been eighteen who returned on the
      SPEEDWELL to London. We know who six of them were, leaving twelve, or two
      thirds, unknown. Whether these twelve were in part from Leyden, and were
      part English, we shall probably never know. If any of them were from
      Holland, then the number of those who left Delfshaven on the SPEEDWELL is
      increased by so many. If any were of the English contingent, and probably
      the most were,&mdash;then the passenger list of the MAY-FLOWER from London
      to Southampton was probably, by so many, the larger. It is evident, from
      Bradford&rsquo;s remark, that, among the twelve unknown, were some who, from
      &ldquo;their own weakness and charge of many young children, were thought least
      useful and most unfit,&rdquo; etc. From this it is clear that at least one
      family was included which had a number of young children, the parents&rsquo;
      &ldquo;own weakness&rdquo; being recognized. A father, mother, and four children (in
      view of the term &ldquo;many&rdquo;) would seem a reasonable surmise, and would make
      six, or another third of the whole number. The probability that the
      unknown two thirds were chiefly from England, rather than Holland, is
      increased by observation of the evident care with which, as a rule, those
      from the Leyden congregation were picked, as to strength and fitness, and
      also by the fact that their Leyden homes were broken up. Winslow remarks,
      &ldquo;the youngest and strongest part were to go,&rdquo; and an analysis of the list
      shows that those selected were mostly such. Bradford, in stating that
      Martin was &ldquo;from Billericay in Essex,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;from which part came sundry
      others.&rdquo; It is quite possible that some of the unknown twelve who returned
      were from this locality, as none of those who went on the MAY-FLOWER are
      understood to have hailed from there, beside the Martins.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the colonists still intending to go to America were now gathered in
      one vessel. Whatever previous disposition of them had been made, or
      whatever relations they might have had in the disjointed record of the
      exodus, were ephemeral, and are now lost sight of in the enduring interest
      which attaches to their final and successful &ldquo;going forth&rdquo; as MAY-FLOWER
      Pilgrims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradford informs us&mdash;as already noted&mdash;that, just before the
      departure from Southampton, having &ldquo;ordered and distributed their company
      for either ship, as they conceived for the best,&rdquo; they &ldquo;chose a Governor
      and two or three assistants for each ship, to order the people by the way,
      and see to the disposing of the provisions, and such like affairs. All
      which was not only with the liking of the Masters of the ships, but
      according to their desires.&rdquo; We have seen that under this arrangement
      &mdash;the wisdom and necessity of which are obvious&mdash;Martin was made
      &ldquo;Governor&rdquo; on the &ldquo;biger ship&rdquo; and Cushman his &ldquo;assistante.&rdquo; Although we
      find no mention of the fact, it is rendered certain by the record which
      Bradford makes of the action of the Pilgrim company on December 11, 1620,
      at Cape Cod,&mdash;when they &ldquo;confirmed&rdquo; Deacon John Carver as &ldquo;Governor,&rdquo;&mdash;that
      he was and had been such, over the colonist passengers for the voyage (the
      ecclesiastical authority only remaining to Elder Brewster), Martin holding
      certainly no higher than the second place, made vacant by Cushman&rsquo;s
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, hardly had the Pilgrims shaken the dust of their persecuting
      mother-country from their feet before they set up, by popular voice (above
      religious authority, and even that vested by maritime law in their ships&rsquo;
      officers), a government of themselves, by themselves, and for themselves.
      It was a significant step, and the early revision they made of their
      choice of &ldquo;governors&rdquo; certifies their purpose to have only rulers who
      could command their confidence and respect. Dr. Young says: &ldquo;We know the
      age of but few of the Pilgrims,&rdquo; which has hitherto been true; yet by
      careful examination of reliable data, now available, we are able to deter
      mine very closely the ages of a considerable number, and approximately the
      years of most of the others, at the time of the exodus. No analysis, so
      far as known, has hitherto been made of the vocations (trades, etc.)
      represented by the MAY-FLOWER company. They were, as befitted those bent
      on founding a colony, of considerable variety, though it should be
      understood that the vocations given were, so far as ascertained, the
      callings the individuals who represented them had followed before taking
      ship. Several are known to have been engaged in other pursuits at some
      time, either before their residence in Holland, or during their earlier
      years there. Bradford tells us that most of the Leyden congregation (or
      that portion of it which came from England, in or about 1608) were
      agricultural people. These were chiefly obliged to acquire handicrafts or
      other occupations. A few, e.g. Allerton, Brewster, Bradford, Carver,
      Cooke, and Winslow, had possessed some means, while others had been bred
      to pursuits for which there was no demand in the Low Countries. Standish,
      bred to arms, apparently followed his profession nearly to the time of
      departure, and resumed it in the colony, adding thereto the calling which,
      in all times and all lands, had been held compatible in dignity with that
      of arms,&mdash;the pursuit of agriculture. While always the &ldquo;Sword of the
      White Men,&rdquo; he was the pioneer &ldquo;planter&rdquo; in the first settlement begun (at
      Duxbury) beyond Plymouth limits. Of the &ldquo;arts, crafts or trades&rdquo; of the
      colonists from London and neighboring English localities, but little has
      been gleaned. They were mostly people of some means, tradesmen rather than
      artisans, and at least two (Martin and Mullens) were evidently also of the
      Merchant Adventurers.

    <p>
      Their social (conjugal) conditions&mdash;not previously analyzed, it is
      thought&mdash;have been determined, it is believed, with approximate
      accuracy; though it is of course possible that some were married, of whom
      that fact does not appear, especially among the seamen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passengers of the MAY-FLOWER on her departure from Plymouth (England),
      as arranged for convenience by families, were as appears by the following
      lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the ages given in these lists are the result of much careful study
      of all the latest available data, and are believed, when not exact, to be
      very close approximates; as it has been possible to arrive at results, in
      several cases, only by considerable calculation, the bases of which may
      not always have been entirely reliable, errors may have crept in. Though
      the author is aware that, in a few instances, the age stated does not
      agree with that assigned by other recognized authority, critical
      re-analysis seems to warrant and confirm the figures given.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual and comparative youth of the majority of the colonist leaders
      &mdash;the Pilgrim Fathers&mdash;is matter of comment, even of surprise,
      to most students of Pilgrim history, especially in view of what the Leyden
      congregation had experienced before embarking for America. Only two of the
      leaders exceeded fifty years of age, and of these Governor Carver died
      early. Of the principal men only nine could have been over forty, and of
      these Carver, Chilton, Martin, Mullins, and Priest (more than half died
      within a few months after landing), leaving Brewster, Warren (who died
      early), Cooke, and Hopkins&mdash;neither of the latter hardly forty&mdash;the
      seniors. One does not readily think of Alden as but twenty-one, Winslow as
      only twenty-five, Dr. Fuller as about thirty, Bradford as only thirty-one
      when chosen Governor, Allerton as thirty-two, and Captain Standish as
      thirty-six. Verily they were &ldquo;old heads on young shoulders.&rdquo; It is
      interesting to note that the dominant influence at all times was that of
      the Leyden contingent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these, all except William Butten, who died upon the voyage, reached
      Cape Cod in safety, though some of them had become seriously ill from the
      hardships encountered, and Howland had narrowly escaped drowning. Two were
      added to the number en voyage,&mdash;Oceanus Hopkins, born upon the sea,
      and Peregrine White, born soon after the arrival in Cape Cod harbor. This
      made the total of the passenger list 103, before further depletion by
      death occurred, though several deaths again reduced it before the
      MAY-FLOWER cast anchor in Plymouth harbor, her final haven on the outward
      voyage.

Deacon John Carver&rsquo;s place of birth or early life is not known, but he
     was an Essex County man, and was probably not, until in middle life,
     a member of Robinson&rsquo;s congregation of &ldquo;Independents.&rdquo;  His age is
     determined by collateral evidence.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Mrs. Katherine Carver, it has been supposed by some, was a sister of
     Pastor Robinson.  This supposition rests, apparently, upon the
     expression of Robinson in his parting letter to Carver, where he
     says: &ldquo;What shall I say or write unto you and your good wife, my
     loving sister?&rdquo;  Neither the place of Mrs. Carver&rsquo;s nativity nor her
     age is known.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Desire Minter was evidently a young girl of the Leyden congregation,
     between the ages of fourteen and seventeen, who in some way (perhaps
     through kinship) had been taken into Carver&rsquo;s family.  She returned
     to England early.  See ante, for account of her (probable)
     parentage.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Howland was possibly of kin to Carver and had been apparently some
     years in his family.  Bradford calls him a &ldquo;man-servant,&rdquo; but it is
     evident that &ldquo;employee&rdquo; would be the more correct term, and that he
     was much more than a &ldquo;servant.&rdquo;  It is observable that Howland
     signed the Compact (by Morton&rsquo;s List) before such men as Hopkins,
     the Tilleys, Cooke, Rogers, and Priest, which does not indicate much
     of the &ldquo;servant&rdquo; relation.  His antecedents are not certainly known,
     but that he was of the Essex family of the name seems probable.
     Much effort has been made in recent years to trace his ancestry,
     but without any considerable result.  His age at death (1673)
     determines his age in 1620.  He was older than generally supposed,
     being born about 1593.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Roger Wilder is also called a &ldquo;man-servant&rdquo; by Bradford, and hardly more
     than this is known of him, his death occurring early.  There is no
     clue to his age except that his being called a &ldquo;man-servant&rdquo; would
     seem to suggest that he was of age; but the fact that he did not
     sign the Compact would indicate that he was younger, or he may have
     been extremely ill, as he died very soon after arrival.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
William Latham is called a &ldquo;boy&rdquo; by Bradford, though a lad of 18.  It is
     quite possible he was one of those &ldquo;indentured&rdquo; by the corporation
     of London, but there is no direct intimation of this.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Mrs. Carver&rsquo;s maid,&rdquo; it is fair to presume, from her position as
     lady&rsquo;s-maid and its requirements in those days, was a young woman of
     eighteen or twenty years, and this is confirmed by her early
     marriage.  Nothing is known of her before the embarkation.  She died
     early.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Jasper More, Bradford says, &ldquo;was a child yt was put to him.&rdquo;  Further
     information concerning him is given in connection with his brother
     Richard, &ldquo;indentured&rdquo; to Elder Brewster.  He is erroneously called
     by Justin Winsor in his &ldquo;History of Duxbury&rdquo; (Massachusetts) a child
     of Carver&rsquo;s, as Elizabeth Tilley is &ldquo;his daughter.&rdquo;  Others have
     similarly erred.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Elder William Brewster&rsquo;s known age at his death determines his age in
     1620.  He was born in 1566-67.  His early life was full of interest
     and activity, and his life in Holland and America no less so.  In
     early life he filled important stations.  Steele&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chief of the
     Pilgrims&rdquo; is a most engaging biography of him, and there are others
     hardly less so, Bradford&rsquo;s sketch being one of the best.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Mrs. Mary Brewster&rsquo;s age at her death determines it at the embarkation,
     and is matter of computation.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Love Brewster was the second son of his parents, his elder brother
    Jonathan coming over afterwards.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Wrestling Brewster was but a &ldquo;lad,&rdquo; and his father&rsquo;s third son.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Richard More and his brother, Bradford states, &ldquo;were put to him&rdquo; (Elder
     Brewster) as bound-boys.  For a full account of their English
     origin, Richard&rsquo;s affidavit, etc., see ante.  This makes him but
     about six, but he was perhaps older.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Governor Edward Winslow&rsquo;s known age at his death fixes his age at the
     time of the exodus, and his birth is duly recorded at Droitwich, in
     Worcester, England. (See &ldquo;Winslow Memorial,&rdquo; David Parsons Holton,
     vol. i.  p. 16.)

Mrs. Elizabeth (Barker) Winslow, the first wife of the Governor, appears
     by the data supplied by the record of her marriage in Holland, May
     27, 1618, to have been a maiden of comporting years to her
     husband&rsquo;s, he being then twenty-three.  Tradition makes her slightly
     younger than her husband.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
George Soule, it is evident,&mdash;like Howland,&mdash;though denominated a
     &ldquo;servant&rdquo; by Bradford, was more than this, and should rather have
     been styled, as Goodwin points out, &ldquo;an employee&rdquo; of Edward Winslow.
     His age is approximated by collateral evidence, his marriage, etc.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Elias Story is called &ldquo;man-servant&rdquo; by Bradford, and his age is unknown.
     The fact that he did not sign the Compact indicates that he was
     under age, but extreme illness may have prevented, as he died early.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Ellen More, &ldquo;a little girl that was put to him&rdquo; (Winslow), died early.
     She was sister of the other More children, &ldquo;bound out&rdquo; to Carver and
     Brewster, of whom extended mention has been made.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Governor William Bradford&rsquo;s date of birth fixes his age in 1620.  His
     early home was at Austerfield, in Yorkshire.  Belknap (&ldquo;American
     Biography,&rdquo; vol. ii.  p. 218) says: &ldquo;He learned the art of
     silk-dyeing.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Mrs. Dorothy (May) Bradford&rsquo;s age (the first wife of the Governor) is
     fixed at twenty-three by collateral data, but she may have been
     older.  She was probably from Wisbeach, England.  The manner of her
     tragic death (by drowning, having fallen overboard from the ship in
     Cape Cod harbor), the first violent death in the colony, was
     especially sad, her husband being absent for a week afterward.  It
     is not known that her body was recovered.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Dr. Samuel Fuller, from his marriage record at Leyden, made in 1613, when
     he was a widower, it is fair to assume was about thirty, perhaps
     older, in 1620, as he could, when married, have hardly been under
     twenty-one.  His (third) wife and child were left in Holland.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
William Butten (who died at sea, November 6/16), Bradford calls
     &ldquo;a youth.&rdquo;  He was undoubtedly a &ldquo;servant"-assistant to the doctor.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Isaac Allerton, it is a fair assumption, was about thirty-four in 1620,
     from the fact that he married his first wife October 4, 1611, as he
     was called &ldquo;a young man&rdquo; in the Leyden marriage record.  He is
     called &ldquo;of London, England,&rdquo; by Bradford and on the Leyden records.
     He was made a &ldquo;freeman&rdquo; of Leyden, February 7, 1614.  Arber and
     others state that his early occupation was that of &ldquo;tailor,&rdquo; but he
     was later a tradesman and merchant.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Mary (Norris) Allerton is called a &ldquo;maid of Newbury in England,&rdquo; in the
     Leyden record of her marriage, in October, 1611, and it is the only
     hint as to her age we have.  She was presumably a young woman.  Her
     death followed (a month later) the birth of her still-born son, on
     board the MAY-FLOWER in Plymouth harbor, February 25/March 7, 1621.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Bartholomew Allerton, born probably in 1612/13 (his parents married
     October, 1611), was hence, as stated, about seven or eight years old
     at the embarkation.  He has been represented as older, but this was
     clearly impossible.  He was doubtless born in Holland.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Remember Allerton, apparently Allerton&rsquo;s second child, has (with a
     novelist&rsquo;s license) been represented by Mrs. Austin as considerably
     older than six, in fact nearer sixteen (Goodwin, p. 183, says,
     &ldquo;over 13&rdquo;), but the known years of her mother&rsquo;s marriage and her
     brother&rsquo;s birth make this improbable.  She was, no doubt, born in
     Holland about 1614&mdash;She married Moses Maverick by 1635, and Thomas
     Weston&rsquo;s only child, Elizabeth, was married from her house at
     Marblehead to Roger Conant, son of the first &ldquo;governor&rdquo; of a
     Massachusetts Bay &ldquo;plantation.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Mary Allerton, apparently the third child, could hardly have been much
     more than four years old in 1620, though Goodwin (&ldquo;Pilgrim
     Republic,&rdquo; p.  184) calls her eleven, which is an error.  She was
     probably born in Holland about 1616.  She was the last survivor of
     the passengers of the MAY-FLOWER, dying at Plymouth, New England,
     1699.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Hooke, described by Bradford as a &ldquo;servant-boy,&rdquo; was probably but a
     youth.  He did not sign the Compact. Nothing further is known of him
     except that he died early.  It is quite possible that he may have
     been of London and have been &ldquo;indentured&rdquo; by the municipality to
     Allerton, but the presumption has been that he came, as body-servant
     of Allerton, with him from Leyden.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Captain Standish&rsquo;s years in 1620 are conjectural (from fixed data), as is
     his age at death.  His early home was at Duxborough Hall, in
     Lancashire.  His commission as Captain, from Queen Elizabeth, would
     make his birth about 1584.  Rose Standish, his wife, is said by
     tradition to have been from the Isle of Man, but nothing is known of
     her age or antecedents, except that she was younger than the
     Captain.  She died during the &ldquo;general sickness,&rdquo; early in 1621.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Master Christopher Martin, as previously noted, was from Billerica, in
     Essex.  From collateral data it appears that he must have been
     &ldquo;about forty&rdquo; years old when he joined the Pilgrims.  He appears to
     have been a staunch &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; and to have drawn upon himself the
     ire of the Archdeacon of Chelmsford, (probably) by his loud-mouthed
     expression of his views, as only &ldquo;a month before the MAY-FLOWER
     sailed&rdquo; he, with his son and Solomon Prower of his household
     (probably a relative), were cited before the archdeacon to answer
     for their shortcomings, especially in reverence for this church
     dignitary.  He seems to have been at all times a self-conceited,
     arrogant, and unsatisfactory man.  That he was elected treasurer
     and ship&rsquo;s &ldquo;governor&rdquo; and permitted so much unbridled liberty as
     appears, is incomprehensible.  It was probably fortunate that he
     died early, as he did, evidently in utter poverty.  He had a son,
     in 1620, apparently quite a grown youth, from which it is fair to
     infer that the father was at that time &ldquo;about forty.&rdquo;  Of his wife
     nothing is known.  She also died early.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Solomon Prower, who is called by Bradford both &ldquo;son&rdquo; and &ldquo;servant&rdquo; of
     Martin, seems from the fact of his &ldquo;citation&rdquo; before the Archdeacon
     of Chelmsford, etc., to have been something more than a &ldquo;servant,&rdquo;
      possibly a kinsman, or foster-son, and probably would more properly
     have been termed an &ldquo;employee.&rdquo;  He was from Billerica, in Essex,
     and was, from the fact that he did not sign the Compact, probably
     under twenty-one or very ill at the time.  He died early. Of John
     Langemore, his fellow &ldquo;servant,&rdquo; nothing is known, except that he is
     spoken of by Young as one of two &ldquo;children&rdquo; brought over by Martin
     (but on no apparent authority), and he did not sign the Compact,
     though this might have been from extreme illness, as he too died
     early.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
William White was of the Leyden congregation.  He is wrongly called by
     Davis a son of Bishop John White, as the only English Bishop of that
     name and time died a bachelor.  At White&rsquo;s marriage, recorded at the
     Stadthaus at Leyden, January 27/February 1, 1612, to Anna [Susanna]
     Fuller, he is called &ldquo;a young man of England.&rdquo;  As he presumably was
     of age at that time, he must have been at least some twenty-nine or
     thirty years old at the embarkation, eight years later.  His son
     Peregrine was born in Cape Cod harbor.  Mr. White died very early.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Susanna (Fuller) White, wife of William, and sister of Dr. Fuller (?),
     was apparently somewhat younger than her first husband and perhaps
     older than her second.  She must, in all probability (having been
     married in Leyden in 1612), have been at least twenty-five at the
     embarkation eight years later.  Her second husband, Governor
     Winslow, was but twenty-five in 1620, and the presumption is that
     she was slightly his senior.   There appears no good reason for
     ascribing to her the austere and rather unlovable characteristics
     which the pen of Mrs. Austin has given her.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Resolved White, the son of William and Susanna White, could not have been
     more than six or seven years old, and is set down by Goodwin and
     others&mdash;on what seems inconclusive evidence&mdash;at five.  He was
     doubtless born at Leyden.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
William Holbeck is simply named as &ldquo;a servant&rdquo; of White, by Bradford.
     His age does not appear, but as he did not sign the Compact he was
     probably &ldquo;under age.&rdquo;  From the fact that he died early, it is
     possible that he was too ill to sign.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Edward Thompson is named by Bradford as a second &ldquo;servant&rdquo; of Master
     White, but nothing more is known of him, except that he did not sign
     the Compact, and was therefore probably in his nonage, unless
     prevented by severe sickness.  He died very early.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Master William Mullens (or Molines, as Bradford some times calls him) is
     elsewhere shown to have been a tradesman of some means, of Dorking,
     in Surrey, one of the Merchant Adventurers, and a man of ability.
     From the fact that he left a married daughter (Mrs. Sarah Blunden)
     and a son (William) a young man grown, in England, it is evident
     that he must have been forty years old or more when he sailed for
     New England, only to die aboard the ship in New Plymouth harbor.
     That he was not a French Huguenot of the Leyden contingent, as
     pictured by Rev. Dr. Baird and Mrs. Austin, is certain.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Mrs. Alice Mullens, whose given name we know only from her husband&rsquo;s
     will, filed in London, we know little about.  Her age was (if she
     was his first wife) presumably about that of her husband, whom she
     survived but a short time.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Joseph Mullens was perhaps older than his sister Priscilla, and the third
     child of his parents; but the impression prevails that he was
     slightly her junior,&mdash;on what evidence it is hard to say.  That he
     was sixteen is rendered certain by the fact that he is reckoned by
     his father, in his will, as representing a share in the planter&rsquo;s
     half-interest in the colony, and to do so must have been of that
     age.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Priscilla Mullens, whom the glamour of unfounded romance and the pen of
     the poet Longfellow have made one of the best known and best beloved
     of the Pilgrim band, was either a little older, or younger, than her
     brother Joseph, it is not certain which.  But that she was over
     sixteen is made certain by the same evidence as that named
     concerning  her brother.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Robert Carter is named by Bradford as a &ldquo;man-servant,&rdquo; and Mrs. Austin,
     in her imaginative &ldquo;Standish of Standish,&rdquo; which is never to be
     taken too literally, has made him (see p. 181 of that book) &ldquo;a dear
     old servant,&rdquo; whom Priscilla Mullens credits with carrying her in
     his arms when a small child, etc.  Both Bradford&rsquo;s mention and Mr.
     Mullens&rsquo;s will indicate that he was yet a young man and &ldquo;needed
     looking after.&rdquo;  He did not sign the Compact, which of itself
     indicates nonage, unless illness was the cause, of which, in his
     case, there is no evidence, until later.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Richard Warren, as he had a wife and five pretty well grown daughters,
     must have been forty-five or more when he came over.  He is
     suggested to have been from Essex.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Stephen Hopkins is believed to have been a &ldquo;lay-reader&rdquo; with Mr. Buck,
     chaplain to Governor Gates, of the Bermuda expedition of 1609 (see
     Purchas, vol. iv.  p. 174).  As he could hardly have had this
     appointment, or have taken the political stand he did, until  of
     age, he must have been at least twenty-one at that time.  If so, he
     would have been not less than thirty two years old in 1620, and was
     probably considerably older, as his son Giles is represented by
     Goodwin (&ldquo;Pilgrim Republic,&rdquo; p. 184) as being &ldquo;about 15.&rdquo;  If the
     father was but twenty-one when the son was born, he must have been
     at least thirty-seven when he became a MAY-FLOWER Pilgrim.  The
     probabilities are that he was considerably older.  His English home
     is not known.  Professor Arber makes an error (The Story of the
     Pilgrim Fathers,&rdquo; p. 261) in regard to Hopkins which, unless noted,
     might lead to other and more serious mistakes.  Noting the
     differences between John Pierce and a Master Hopkins, heard before
     the Council for New England, May 5/15, 1623, Arber designates Master
     Hopkins as &ldquo;Stephen&rdquo; (on what authority does not appear), and leaves
     us to infer that it was the Pilgrim Hopkins. On further inquiry it
     transpires that the person who was at variance with Master John
     Pierce over the matter of passage and freight money, on account of
     the unfortunate PARAGON, was a Rev. Master Hopkins (not Stephen of
     the MAY-FLOWER), who, we learn from Neill&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of the Virginia
     Company,&rdquo; was &ldquo;recommended July 3, 1622, by the Court of the Company
     to the Governor of Virginia, .  .  . being desirous to go over at
     his own charge.  He was evidently a passenger on both of the
     disastrous attempts of the PARAGON under Captain William Pierce, and
     being forced back the second time, apparently gave up the intention
     of going.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Mrs. Elizabeth Hopkins, nothing is known concerning, except that she was
     not her husband&rsquo;s first wife.  Sometime apparently elapsed between
     her husband&rsquo;s marriages.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Giles Hopkins we only know was the son of his father&rsquo;s first wife, and
     &ldquo;about 15.&rdquo;  An error (of the types presumably) makes Griffis (&ldquo;The
     Pilgrims in their Three Homes,&rdquo; p. 176) give the name of Oceanus
     Hopkins&rsquo;s father as Giles, instead of Stephen.  Constance (or
     Constantia) Hopkins was apparently about eleven years old in 1620,
     as she married in 1627, and probably was then not far from eighteen
     years old. Damaris Hopkins, the younger daughter of Master Hopkins,
     was probably a very young child when she came in the MAY-FLOWER, but
     her exact age has not been as certained.  Davis, as elsewhere noted,
     makes the singular mistake of saying she was born after her parents
     arrived in New England.  She married Jacob Cooke, and the
     ante-nuptial agreement of his parents is believed to be the
     earliest of record in America, except that between Gregory
     Armstrong and the widow Billington.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Edward Dotey is called by Bradford &ldquo;a servant,&rdquo; but nothing is known of
     his age or antecedents.  It is very certain from the fact that he
     signed the Compact that he was twenty-one.  He was a very energetic
     man. He seems to have been married before coming to New England, or
     soon after.
</pre>

Edward Leister (the name is variously spelled) was a &ldquo;servant,&rdquo; by
     Bradford&rsquo;s record.  He was doubtless of age, as he signed the
     Compact.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Master John Crackstone, being (apparently) a widower with a son, a child
     well grown, was evidently about thirty five years old when he
     embarked for New England. He left a daughter behind.  He died early.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    John Crackstone, Jr., was but a lad, and died early.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Master Edward Tilley (sometimes spelled Tillie) and his wife Ann seem to
     have been without children of their own, and as they took with them
     to New England two children who were their kindred, it may be
     inferred that they had been married some little time. It is hence
     probable that Mr. Tilley was in the neighborhood of thirty.  His
     wife&rsquo;s age is purely conjectural.  They were, Bradford states, &ldquo;of
     the Leyden congregation.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Henry Sampson was apparently but a young English lad when he came over in
     the MAY-FLOWER with his cousins the Tilleys.  As he married in 1636,
     he was probably then about twenty-one, which would make him five or
     six when he came over.  Goodwin (&ldquo;Pilgrim Republic,&rdquo; p. 184) says he
     was &ldquo;six.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Humility Cooper is said by Bradford to have been a &ldquo;cosen&rdquo; of the
     Tilleys, but no light is given as to her age or antecedents.  She
     was but a child, apparently.  She returned to England very soon
     after the death of Mr. and Mrs. Tilley, and &ldquo;died young.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Master John Tilley, having twice married, and having a daughter some
     fourteen years old, must have been over thirty-five years old when
     he sailed on the Pilgrim ship.  His birthplace and antecedents are
     not known, but he was &ldquo;of the Leyden congregation.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Mrs. Bridget (Van der Velde) Tilley was just possibly a second wife.
     Nothing is known concerning her except that she was of Holland, and
     that she had, apparently, no child.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Elizabeth Tilley is said by Goodwin (op. cit.  p. 298) and others to have
     been fourteen years old at her parents&rsquo; death in 1621, soon after
     the arrival in New England.  She was the child of her father&rsquo;s first
     wife.  She married John Howland before 1624.  Historians for many
     years called her the &ldquo;daughter of Governor Carver,&rdquo; but the recovery
     of Bradford&rsquo;s MS. &ldquo;historie&rdquo; corrected this, with many other
     misconceptions, though to some the error had become apparent before.
     Her will also suggests her age.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Francis Cooke&rsquo;s age in 1620 is fixed by his known age at his death
     (&ldquo;about 81&rdquo;) in 1663.  He was from the north of England, and long a
     member of Robinson&rsquo;s congregation, both in England and in
     Holland(?).
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Cooke, son of Francis, is known to have been about ten years old
     when he sailed with his father for America, as his parents did not
     marry before 1609.  He was undoubtedly born at Leyden.  He was long
     supposed to have been the last male survivor of the original
     passengers (dying at Dartmouth in 1695.)
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
James Chilton&rsquo;s antecedents and his age are quite unknown. He must have
     been at least fifty, as he had a married daughter in Leyden,
     according to Bradford.  He died among the first, and there is
     nothing of record to inform us concerning him, except Bradford&rsquo;s
     meagre mention.  He may have lived at Leyden.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Mrs. Chilton&rsquo;s given name is declared by one writer to have been Susanna,
     but it is not clearly proven.  Whence she came, her ancestry, and
     her age, are alike unknown.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Mary Chilton was but a young girl in 1620.  She married, before 1627,
     John Winslow, and was probably not then over twenty, nor over
     fourteen when she came with her parents in the MAY-FLOWER.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Thomas Rogers appears, from the fact that he had a son, a lad well-grown,
     to have been thirty or more in 1620.  His birthplace, antecedents,
     and history are unknown, but he appears to have been &ldquo;of the Leyden
     congregation.&rdquo;  His wife and children came later.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Joseph Rogers was only a &ldquo;lad&rdquo; aboard the MAY-FLOWER, but he left a
     considerable posterity.  Nothing is surely known of him, except that
     he was Thomas&rsquo;s son.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Degory Priest had the distinction of being &ldquo;freeman&rdquo; of Leyden, having
     been admitted such, November 16, 1615.  He was by occupation a
     &ldquo;hatter,&rdquo; a man of some means, who left a wife and at least two
     children in Holland when he embarked for America.  His known age at
     death gives his age at sailing but a few months previous.  At his
     marriage in Leyden, October 4, 1611, he was called &ldquo;of London.&rdquo;  He
     was about thirty-two when he married.  His wife (a widow Vincent)
     was a sister of Isaac Allerton, who also was married at the same
     time that he was. Goodwin (&ldquo;Pilgrim Republic,&rdquo; p. 183) also gives
     his age as &ldquo;forty-one.&rdquo;  His widow remarried and came over later.
     Dexter (&ldquo;Mourt&rsquo;s Relation,&rdquo; p. 69, note) states, quoting from Leyden
     MS. records, that &ldquo;Degory Priest in April, 1619, calling himself a
     &lsquo;hatter,&rsquo; deposes that he &lsquo;is forty years of age.&rsquo;&rdquo;  He must,
     therefore, have been about forty-one when he sailed on the
     MAY-FLOWER, and forty-two years old at his death.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Rigdale and his wife Alice afford no data.  They both died early,
     and there is no record concerning either of them beyond the fact
     that they were passengers.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Edward Fuller and his wife have left us little record of themselves save
     that they were of Leyden, that he is reputed a brother of Dr. Samuel
     Fuller (for whom they seem to have named the boy they brought over
     with them,&mdash;leaving apparently another son, Matthew, behind), and
     that both died the first winter.  He must have been at least
     twenty-five, judging from the fact that he was married and had two
     children, and was perhaps somewhat older (though traditionally
     represented as younger) than his brother.  Neither his occupation
     nor antecedents are surely known.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Samuel Fuller&mdash;the son of Edward Fuller and his wife&mdash;is called by
     Bradford &ldquo;a young child.&rdquo;  He must have been some five or six years
     of age, as he married in 1635, fifteen years later, and would
     presumably have been of age, or nearly so.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Thomas Tinker&rsquo;s name, the mention of his &ldquo;wife&rdquo; and &ldquo;son,&rdquo; the tradition
     that they were &ldquo;of the Leyden congregation&rdquo; (which is not sure), the
     certainty that they were MAY-FLOWER passengers,&mdash;on Brad ford&rsquo;s
     list,&mdash;and that all died early, are all we know of the Tinker
     family.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Turner and his two sons we know little about.  He seems to have been
     a widower, as no mention is found of his wife, though this is not
     certain.  He was of the Leyden congregation, and evidently a man of
     some standing with the leaders, as he was made their messenger to
     Carver and Cushman in London, in June, 1620, and was apparently
     accustomed to travel. He appears to have had business of his own in
     England at the time, and was apparently a man of sober age.  As he
     had three children,&mdash;a daughter who came later to New England, and
     two sons, as stated by Bradford,&mdash;it is probable that he was thirty
     or over.  He and both his sons died in the spring of 1621.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Francis Eaton was of Leyden, a carpenter, and, having a wife and child,
     was probably a young man about twenty five, perhaps a little
     younger.  He married three times.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Mrs. Sarah Eaton, wife of Francis, was evidently a young woman, with an
     infant, at the date of embarkation.  Nothing more is known of her,
     except that she died the spring following the arrival at Plymouth.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Samuel Eaton, the son of Francis and his wife, Sarah, Bradford calls &ldquo;a
     sucking child:&rdquo; He lived to marry.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
Gilbert Window was the third younger brother of Governor Edward Winslow,
     and is reputed to have been a carpenter.  He was born on Wednesday,
     October 26, 1600, at Droitwitch, in Worcester, England.  (&ldquo;Winslow
     Memorial,&rdquo; vol. i.  p. 23.)  He apparently did not remain long in
     the colony, as he does not appear in either the &ldquo;land division&rdquo; of
     1623 or the &ldquo;cattle division&rdquo; of 1627; and hence was probably not
     then in the &ldquo;settlement,&rdquo; though land was later allowed his heirs,
     he having been an &ldquo;original&rdquo; voyager of the Plymouth colony.  He was
     but twenty years and fifteen days old when he signed the Compact,
     but probably was&mdash;from his brother&rsquo;s prominence and his nearness to
     his majority&mdash;counted as eligible. Bradford states that he returned
     to England after &ldquo;divers years&rdquo; in New England, and died there. It
     has been suggested that he went very early to some of the other
     &ldquo;plantations.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Alden was of Southampton, England, was hired as &ldquo;a cooper,&rdquo; was
     twenty-one years old in 1620, as determined by the year of his
     birth, 1599 (&ldquo;Alden Memorial,&rdquo; p. 1), and became the most prominent
     and useful of any of the English contingent of the MAY FLOWER
     company.  Longfellow&rsquo;s delightful poem, &ldquo;The Courtship of Miles
     Standish,&rdquo; has given him and his bride, Priscilla Mullens,
     world-wide celebrity, though it is to be feared that its historical
     accuracy would hardly stand criticism.  Why young Alden should have
     been &ldquo;hired for a cooper at Southampton,&rdquo; with liberty to &ldquo;go or
     stay&rdquo; in the colony, as Bradford says he was (clearly indicating
     that he went to perform some specific work and return, if he liked,
     with the ship), has mystified many.  The matter is clear, however,
     when it is known, as Griffis shows, that part of a Parliamentary Act
     of 1543 reads: &ldquo;Whosoever shall carry Beer beyond Sea, shall find
     Sureties to the Customers (?) of that Port, to bring in Clapboard
     [staves] meet [sufficient] to make so much Vessel [barrel or
     &ldquo;kilderkin&rdquo;] as he shall carry forth.&rdquo;  As a considerable quantity of
     beer was part of the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S lading, and her consignors stood
     bound to make good in quantity the stave-stock she carried away,
     it was essential, in going to a wild country where it could not be
     bought, but must be &ldquo;got out&rdquo; from the growing timber, to take along
     a &ldquo;cooper and cleaver&rdquo; for that purpose.  Moreover, the great demand
     for beer-barrel stock made &ldquo;clapboard&rdquo; good and profitable return
     lading.  It constituted a large part of the FORTUNE&rsquo;S return freight
     (doubtless &ldquo;gotten out&rdquo; by Alden), as it would have undoubtedly of
     the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S, had the hardship of the colony&rsquo;s condition
     permitted.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Peter Browne we know little concerning.  That he was a man of early
     middle age is inferable from the fact that he married the widow
     Martha Ford, who came in the FORTUNE in 1621.  As she then was the
     mother of three children, it is improbable that she would have
     married a very young man.  He appears, from certain collateral
     evidence, to have been a mechanic of some kind, but it is not clear
     what his handicraft was or whence he came.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Billington (Bradford sometimes spells it Billinton) and his family,
     Bradford tells us, &ldquo;were from London.&rdquo;  They were evidently an
     ill-conditioned lot, and unfit for the company of the planters, and
     Bradford says, &ldquo;I know not by what friend shuffled into their
     Company.&rdquo;  As he had a wife and two children, the elder of whom must
     have been about sixteen years old, he was apparently over
     thirty-five years of age.  There is a tradition that he was a
     countryman bred, which certain facts seem to confirm.  (See land
     allotments for data as to age of boys, 1632.)  He was the only one
     of the original colonists to suffer the &ldquo;death penalty&rdquo; for crime.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Mrs. Ellen (or &ldquo;Elen&rdquo;) Billington, as Bradford spells the name, was
     evidently of comporting age to her husband&rsquo;s, perhaps a little
     younger.  Their two sons, John and Francis, were lively urchins who
     frequently made matters interesting for the colonists, afloat and
     ashore.  The family was radically bad throughout, but they have had
     not a few worthy descendants. Mrs. Billington married Gregory
     Armstrong, and their antenuptial agreement is the first of record
     known in America.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Billington, Jr., is always first named of his father&rsquo;s two sons, and
     hence the impression prevails that he was the elder, and Bradford so
     designates him.  The affidavit of Francis Billington (Plymouth
     County, Mass., Deeds, vol. i.  p. 81), dated 1674, in which he
     declares himself sixty-eight years old, would indicate that he was
     born in 1606, and hence must have been about fourteen years of age
     when he came on the MAY-FLOWER to New Plymouth.  If John, his
     brother, was older than he, he must have been born about 1604, and
     so was about sixteen when, he came to New England.  The indications
     are that it was Francis, the younger son, who got hold of the
     gunpowder in his father&rsquo;s cabin in Cape Cod harbor, and narrowly
     missed blowing up the ship.  John died before 1630.  Francis lived,
     as appears, to good age, and had a family.

Moses Fletcher was of the Leyden company, a &ldquo;smith,&rdquo; and at the time of
     his second marriage at Leyden, November 30/December 21, 1613, was
     called a &ldquo;widower&rdquo; and &ldquo;of England.&rdquo;  As he was probably of age at
     the time of his first marriage,&mdash;presumably two years or more before
     his last,&mdash;he must have been over thirty in 1620.  He was perhaps
     again a widower when he came over, as no mention is made of his
     having wife or family.  He was possibly of the Amsterdam family of
     that name.  His early death was a great loss to the colony.

A Thomas Williams is mentioned by Hon. Henry C  Murphy (&ldquo;Historical
     Magazine,&rdquo; vol. iii.  pp. 358, 359), in a list of some of Robinson&rsquo;s
     congregation who did not go to New England in either the MAY-FLOWER,
     FORTUNE, ANNE, Or LITTLE JAMES.  He either overlooked the fact that
     Williams was one of the MAY-FLOWER passengers, or else there were
     two of the name, one of whom did not go.  Nothing is known of the
     age or former history of the Pilgrim of that name.  He died in the
     spring of 1621 (before the end of March). As he signed the Compact,
     he must have been over twenty-one.  He may have left a wife, Sarah.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Goodman we know little more about than that he and Peter Browne seem
     to have been &ldquo;lost&rdquo; together, on one occasion (when he was badly
     frozen), and to have had, with his little spaniel dog, a rencontre
     with &ldquo;two great wolves,&rdquo; on another.  He was twice married, the last
     time at Leyden in 1619.  He died before the end of March, 1621.
     As he signed the Compact, he must have been over twenty-one.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Edward Margeson we know nothing about.  As he signed the Compact, he was
     presumably of age.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Richard Britteridge affords little data.  His age, birthplace, or
     occupation do not transpire, but he was, it seems, according to
     Bradford, the first of the company to die on board the ship after
     she had cast anchor in the harbor of New Plymouth.  This fact
     negatives the pleasant fiction of Mrs. Austin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Standish of
     Standish&rdquo; (p. 104), that Britteridge was one of those employed in
     cutting sedge on shore on Friday, January 12.  Poor Britteridge died
     December 21, three weeks earlier.  He signed the Compact, and hence
     may be accounted of age at the landing at Cape Cod.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Richard Clarke appears only as one of the passengers and as dying before
     the end of March.  He signed the Compact, and hence was doubtless
     twenty-one or over.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Richard Gardiner, we know from Bradford, &ldquo;became a seaman and died in
     England or at sea.&rdquo;  He was evidently a young man, but of his age or
     antecedents nothing appears.  He signed the Compact, and hence was
     at least twenty-one years old.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
John Alderton (sometimes spelled Allerton), we are told by Bradford,&mdash;as
     elsewhere noted,&mdash;&ldquo;was hired, but was reputed one of the company,
     but was to go back, being a seaman and so, presumably, unmindful of
     the voyages, for the help of others.&rdquo;  Whether Bradford intended by
     the latter clause to indicate that he had left his family behind,
     and came &ldquo;to spy out the land,&rdquo; and, if satisfied, to return for
     them, or was to return for the counsel and assistance of Robinson
     and the rest, who were to follow, is not clear, but the latter view
     has most to support it.  We learn his occupation, but can only infer
     that he was a young man over twenty-one from the above and the fact
     that he signed the Compact.  It has been suggested that he was a
     relative of Isaac Allerton, but this is nowhere shown and is
     improbable.  He died before the MAY-FLOWER returned to England.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Thomas English (or Enlish), Bradford tells us (&ldquo;Historie,&rdquo; Mass. ed.
     p. 533), &ldquo;was hired to goe Master of a [the] shallop here.&rdquo;  He,
     however, &ldquo;died here before the ship returned.&rdquo;  It is altogether
     probable that he was the savior of the colony on that stormy night
     when the shallop made Plymouth harbor the first time, and, narrowly
     escaping destruction, took shelter under Clarke&rsquo;s Island.  The first
     three governors of the colony, its chief founders,&mdash;Carver,
     Bradford, and Winslow,&mdash;with Standish, Warren, Hopkins, Howland,
     Dotey, and others, were on board, and but for the heroism and prompt
     action of &ldquo;the lusty sea man which steered,&rdquo; who was&mdash;beyond
     reasonable doubt&mdash;English, as Bradford&rsquo;s narrative (&ldquo;Morton&rsquo;s
     Memorial&rdquo;) shows, the lives of the entire party must, apparently,
     have been lost.  That English was, if on board&mdash;Bradford shows in
     the &ldquo;Memorial&rdquo; that he was&mdash;as Master of the shallop, properly her
     helmsman in so critical a time, goes without saying, especially as
     the &ldquo;rudder was broken&rdquo; and an oar substituted; that the ship&rsquo;s
     &ldquo;mates,&rdquo; Clarke and Coppin, were not in charge (although on board)
     fully appears by Bradford&rsquo;s account; and as it must have taken all
     of the other (four) seamen on board to pull the shallop, bereft of
     her sail, in the heavy breakers into which she had been run by
     Coppin&rsquo;s blunder, there would be no seaman but English for the
     steering-oar, which was his by right.  Had these leaders been lost
     at this critical time,&mdash;before a settlement had been made,&mdash;it is
     certain that the colony must have been abandoned, and the Pilgrim
     impress upon America must have been lost.  English&rsquo;s name should, by
     virtue of his great service, be ever held in high honor by all of
     Pilgrim stock.  His early death was a grave loss. Bradford spells
     the name once Enlish, but presumably by error.  He signed the
     Compact as Thomas English.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
William Trevore was, according to Bradford, one of &ldquo;two seamen hired to
     stay a year in the countrie.&rdquo;  He went back when his time expired,
     but later returned to New England.  Cushman (Bradford, &ldquo;Historie,&rdquo;
      p. 122) suggests that he was telling &ldquo;sailors&rsquo; yarns.&rdquo;  He says:
     &ldquo;For William Trevore hath lavishly told but what he knew or imagined
     of Capewock Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, Monhiggon, and ye Narragansetts.&rdquo;  In
     1629 he was at Massachusetts Bay in command of the HANDMAID
     (Goodwin, p. 320), and in February, 1633 (Winthrop, vol. i. p. 100),
     he seems to have been in command of the ship WILLIAM at Plymouth,
     with passengers for Massachusetts Bay.  Captain Standish testified
     in regard to Thompson&rsquo;s Island in Boston harbor, that about 1620 he
     &ldquo;was on that Island with Trevore,&rdquo; and called it &ldquo;Island Trevore.&rdquo;
      (Bradford, &ldquo;Historie,&rdquo; Deane&rsquo;s ed.  p. 209.)  He did not sign the
     Compact, perhaps because of the limitations of his contract (one
     year).

<pre xml:space="preserve">
&mdash;- Ely (not Ellis, as Arber miscalls him, &ldquo;The Story of the Pilgrim
     Fathers,&rdquo; p. 377) was the other of the &ldquo;two seamen hired to stay a
     year,&rdquo; etc.  He also returned when his time expired.  (Bradford,
     Hist. Mass. ed.  p. 534.) He did not sign the Compact, probably for
     the reason operative in .Trevore&rsquo;s case.  A digest of the foregoing
     data gives the following interesting, if incomplete, data (errors

      Allowing for the addition of Wilder and the two sailors, Trevore and Ely,
      who did not sign it, the number of those who signed the Compact tallies
      exactly with the adult males. Besides these occupations, it is known that
      several of the individuals representing them were skilled in other
      callings, and were at some time teachers, accountants, linguists, writers,
      etc., while some had formerly practised certain handicrafts; Dr. Fuller,
      e.g. having formerly been a &ldquo;silk-worker,&rdquo; Brad ford (on the authority of
      Belknap), a &ldquo;silk-dyer,&rdquo; and others &ldquo;fustian-workers.&rdquo; Hopkins had
      apparently sometime before dropped his character of &ldquo;lay-reader,&rdquo; and was
      a pretty efficient man of affairs, but his vocation at the time of the
      exodus is not known.
    </p>
    <p>
      The former occupations of fourteen of the adult colonists, Browne,
      Billington, Britteridge, Cooke, Chilton, Clarke, Crackstone, Goodman,
      Gardiner, Rogers, Rigdale, Turner, Warren, and Williams are not certainly
      known. There is evidence suggesting that Browne was a mechanic; Billington
      and Cooke had been trained to husbandry; that Chilton had been a small
      tradesman; that Edward Tilley had been, like his brother, a silk-worker;
      that Turner was a tradesman, and Warren a farmer; while it is certain that
      Cooke, Rogers, and Warren had been men of some means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the above list of fourteen men whose last occupations before joining
      the colonists are unknown, only five, viz. Browne, Billington, Cooke,
      Gardiner, and Warren lived beyond the spring of 1621. Of these, Warren
      died early, Gardiner left the colony and &ldquo;became a seaman;&rdquo; the other
      three, Billington, Browne, and Cooke, became &ldquo;planters.&rdquo; Thomas Morton, of
      &ldquo;Merry Mount,&rdquo; in his &ldquo;New Eng land&rsquo;s Canaan&rdquo; (p. 217), gives Billington
      the sobriquet &ldquo;Ould Woodman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The early deaths of the others make their former handicrafts&mdash;except
      as so much data pertaining to the composi tion and history of the colony&mdash;
      matters of only ephemeral interest.

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      QUARTERS, COOKING, PROVISIONS
    </h3>
    <p>
      Probably no more vexatious problem presented itself for the time being to
      the &ldquo;governors&rdquo; of the two vessels and their &ldquo;assistants,&rdquo; upon their
      selection, than the assignment of quarters to the passengers allotted to
      their respective ships. That these allotments were in a large measure
      determined by the requirements of the women and children may be considered
      certain. The difficulties attendant on due recognition of social and
      official station (far more imperative in that day than this) were in no
      small degree lessened by the voluntary assignment of themselves, already
      mentioned, of some of the Leyden chief people to the smaller ship; but in
      the interests of the general welfare and of harmony, certain of the
      leaders, both of the Leyden and London contingents, were of necessity
      provided for in the larger vessel. The allotments to the respective ships
      made at Southampton, the designation of quarters in the ships themselves,
      and the final readjustments upon the MAY-FLOWER at Plymouth (England),
      when the remaining passengers of both ships had been united, were all
      necessarily determined chiefly with regard to the needs of the women,
      girls, and babes. Careful analysis of the list shows that there were,
      requiring this especial consideration, nineteen women, ten young girls,
      and one infant. Of the other children, none were so young that they might
      not readily bunk with or near their fathers in any part of the ship in
      which the latter might be located.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know enough of the absolute unselfishness and devotion of all the
      Leyden leaders, whatever their birth or station,&mdash;so grandly proven
      in those terrible days of general sickness and death at New Plymouth,&mdash;to
      be certain that with them, under all circumstances, it was noblesse
      oblige, and that no self-seeking would actuate them here. It should be
      remembered that the MAY-FLOWER was primarily a passenger transport, her
      passengers being her principal freight and occupying the most of the ship,
      the heavier cargo being chiefly confined to the &ldquo;hold.&rdquo; As in that day the
      passenger traffic was, of course, wholly by sailing vessels, they were
      built with cabin accommodations for it, as to numbers, etc.,
      proportionately much beyond those of the sailing craft of to-day. The
      testimony of Captain John Smith, &ldquo;the navigator,&rdquo; as to the passengers of
      the MAY-FLOWER &ldquo;lying wet in their cabins,&rdquo; and that of Bradford as to
      Billington&rsquo;s &ldquo;cabin between decks,&rdquo; already quoted, is conclusive as to
      the fact that she had small cabins (the &ldquo;staterooms&rdquo; of to-day), intended
      chiefly, no doubt, for women and children. The advice of Edward Winslow to
      his friend George Morton, when the latter was about to come to New England
      in the ANNE, &ldquo;build your cabins as open as possible,&rdquo; is suggestive of
      close cabins and their discomforts endured upon the MAY-FLOWER. It also
      suggests that the chartering-party was expected in those days to control,
      if not to do, the &ldquo;fitting up&rdquo; of the ship for her voyage. In view of the
      usual &ldquo;breadth of beam&rdquo; of ships of her class and tonnage, aft, and the
      fore and aft length of the poop, it is not unreasonable to suppose that
      there were not less than four small cabins on either side of the common
      (open) cabin or saloon (often depicted as the signing-place of the
      Compact), under the high poop deck. Constructed on the general plan of
      such rooms or cabins to-day (with four single berths, in tiers of two on
      either hand), there would be&mdash;if the women and girls were
      conveniently distributed among them&mdash;space for all except the
      Billingtons, who we know had a cabin (as had also doubtless several of the
      principal men) built between decks. This would also leave an after cabin
      for the Master, who not infrequently made his quarters, and those of his
      chief officer, in the &ldquo;round house,&rdquo; when one existed, especially in a
      crowded ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cabins and bunks &ldquo;between decks&rdquo; would provide for all of the males of the
      company, while the seamen, both of the crew and (some of) those in the
      employ of the Pilgrims&mdash;like Trevore and Ely&mdash;were no doubt
      housed in the fore castle. Alderton and English seem to have been counted
      &ldquo;of the company.&rdquo; The few data we have permit us to confidently assume
      that some such disposition of the passengers was (necessarily) made, and
      that but for the leaky decks, the inseparable discomforts of the sea, and
      those of over crowding, the wives of the Pilgrims (three of whom gave
      birth to children aboard the ship), and their daughters, were fairly
      &ldquo;berthed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bradford is authority for the statement that with the &ldquo;governor&rdquo; of the
      ship&rsquo;s company were chosen &ldquo;two or three assistants . . . to order
      [regulate] the people by the way [on the passage] and see to the
      disposition of the provisions,&rdquo; etc. The last-named duty must have been a
      most difficult and wearisome one. From what has been shown of the poverty
      of the ship&rsquo;s cooking facilities (especially for so large a company), one
      must infer that it would be hopeless to expect to cook food in any
      quantity, except when all conditions favored, and then but slowly and with
      much difficulty. From the fact that so many would require food at
      practically the same hours of the day, it is clear that there must have
      been distribution of food (principally uncooked) to groups or families,
      who, with the aid of servants (when available), must each have prepared
      their own meals, cooking as occasion and opportunity indicated; much after
      the manner of the steerage passengers in later days, but before those of
      the great ocean liners. There appears to have been but one cook for the
      officers and crew of the ship, and his hands were doubtless full with
      their demands. It is certain that his service to the passengers must have
      been very slight. That &ldquo;the cook&rdquo; is named as one of the ship&rsquo;s crew who
      died in Plymouth harbor (New England) is all the knowledge we have
      concerning him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of and dependence upon tea and coffee, now so universal, and at
      sea so seemingly indispensable, was then unknown, beer supplying their
      places, and this happily did not have to be prepared with fire. &ldquo;Strong
      waters&rdquo;&mdash;Holland gin and to some extent &ldquo;aqua vitae&rdquo; (brandy)&mdash;were
      relied upon for the (supposed) maintenance of warmth. Our Pilgrim Fathers
      were by no means &ldquo;total abstainers,&rdquo; and sadly bewailed being deprived of
      their beer when the supply failed. They also made general and habitual
      (moderate) use of wine and spirits, though they sharply interdicted and
      promptly punished their abuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the absence of cooking facilities, it became necessary in that day to
      rely chiefly upon such articles of food as did not require to be prepared
      by heat, such as biscuit (hard bread), butter, cheese (&ldquo;Holland cheese&rdquo;
       was a chief staple with the Pilgrims), &ldquo;haberdyne&rdquo; (or dried salt
      codfish), smoked herring, smoked (&ldquo;cured &ldquo;) ham and bacon, &ldquo;dried neat&rsquo;s
      tongues,&rdquo; preserved and &ldquo;potted&rdquo; meats (a very limited list in that day),
      fruits, etc. Mush, oatmeal, pease-puddings, pickled eggs, sausage meats,
      salt beef and pork, bacon, &ldquo;spiced beef,&rdquo; such few vegetables as they had
      (chiefly cabbages, turnips, and onions,&mdash;there were no potatoes in
      that day), etc., could be cooked in quantity, when the weather permitted,
      and would then be eaten cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except as dried or preserved fruits, vegetables (notably onions), limes,
      lemon juice, and the free use of vinegar feebly counteracted, their food
      was distinctively stimulant of scorbutic and tuberculosis disease, which
      constant exposure to cold and wet and the overcrowded state of the ship
      could but increase and aggravate. Bradford narrates of one of the crew of
      the MAY-FLOWER when in Plymouth harbor, as suggestive of the wretched
      conditions prevalent in the ship, that one of his shipmates, under an
      agreement to care for him, &ldquo;got him a little spice and made him a mess of
      beef, once or twice,&rdquo; and then deserted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Josselyn, in his &ldquo;Two Voyages to New England,&rdquo; gives as the result of the
      experience and observations had in his voyages, but a few years later,
      much that is interesting and of exceptional value as to the food and
      equipment of passengers to, and colonists in, this part of America. It has
      especial interest, perhaps, for the author and his readers, in the fact
      that Josselyn&rsquo;s statements were not known until after the data given in
      these pages had been independently worked out from various sources, and
      came therefore as a gratifying confirmation of the conclusions already
      reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Josselyn says as to food, as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The common proportion of
      victuals for the sea to a mess (being 4 men) is as followeth:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;2 pieces of Beef of 3 lb. 1/4 apiece. Pork seems to have been
      inadvertently omitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four pounds of Bread [ship-bread].
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One pint &amp; 1/2 of Pease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four Gallons of Bear [Beer], with mustard and vinegar for 3 flesh days in
      the week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For four fish days to each mess per day:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two pieces of Codd or Haberdine, making 3 pieces of a fish, i.e. a dried
      salt cod being divided into three pieces, 2 of those pieces were to be a
      day&rsquo;s ration for 4 men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four pounds of Bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three-quarters of a pound of cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bear as before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oatmeal per day for 50 men 1 Gallon [dry], and so proportionable for more
      or fewer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus you see the ship&rsquo;s provision is Beefe and Porke, Fish, Butter,
      Cheese, Pease, Pottage, Water-Gruel, Bisket, and six shilling Bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For private fresh provision you may carry with you (in case you or any of
      yours should be sick at sea):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conserves of Roses, Clove-Gilliflowers, Wormwood, Green-Ginger,
      Burnt-Wine, English Spirits, Prunes to stew, Raisons of the Sun, Currence
      [currants], Sugar, Nutmeg, Mace, Cinnamon, Pepper and Ginger, White
      Bisket, Butter, or &lsquo;Captains biscuit,&rsquo; made with wheat flour or Spanish
      Rusk, Eggs, Rice, Juice of Lemons, well put up to cure or prevent the
      Scurvy, Small Skillets, Pipkins, Porringers and small Frying Pans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Josselyn further gives us an estimate for:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Victuals for a whole year to be carried out of England for one man and so
      for more after this rate.&rdquo; He annexed also their current prices:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Eight bushels of Meal [Rye meal probably intended]
    Two bushels of Pease at 3/s
    Two bushels of Oatmeal at 4s/6d
    One Gallon of Aqua Vitae
    One Gallon of Oyl
    Two Gallons of Vinegar
    [No estimate of Beef or Pork, or of vegetables, is included.]
    A Hogshead of English Bear
    A Hogshead of Irish Bear
    A Hogshead of Vinegar
    A bushel of Mustard seed
    A Kental [Quintal] of fish, Cod or Haberdine, 112 lb.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Edward Window, in his letter to George Morton before mentioned, advising
      him as to his voyage, says: &ldquo;Bring juice of lemons and take it fasting. It
      is of good use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is indeed remarkable that, totally unused to any such conditions, wet,
      cold, poorly fed, overcrowded, storm-tossed, bruised and beaten, anxious,
      and with no homes to welcome them, exposed to new hardships and dangers on
      landing, worn and exhausted, any of the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S company survived. It
      certainly cannot be accounted strange that infectious diseases, once
      started among them, should have run through their ranks like fire, taking
      both old and young. Nor is it strange that&mdash;though more inured to
      hardship and the conditions of sea life&mdash;with the extreme and unusual
      exposure of boat service on the New England coast in mid winter, often
      wading in the icy water and living aboard ship in a highly infected
      atmosphere, the seamen should have succumbed to disease in almost equal
      ratio with the colonists. The author is prepared, after careful
      consideration, to accept and professionally indorse, with few exceptions,
      the conclusions as to the probable character of the decimating diseases of
      the passengers and crew of the MAY-FLOWER, so ably and interestingly
      presented by Dr. Edward E. Cornwall in the &ldquo;New England Magazine&rdquo; for
      February, 1897&mdash;From the fact that Edward Thompson, Jasper More, and
      Master James Chilton died within a month of the arrival at Cape Cod (and
      while the ship lay in that harbor), and following the axiom of vital
      statistics that &ldquo;for each death two are constantly sick,&rdquo; there must have
      been some little (though not to say general) sickness on the MAY-FLOWER
      when she arrived at Cape Cod. It would, in view of the hardship of the
      voyage, have been very remarkable if this had not been the case. It would
      have been still more remarkable if the ill-conditioned, thin-blooded,
      town-bred &ldquo;servants&rdquo; and apprentices had not suffered first and most. It
      is significant that eight out of nine of the male &ldquo;servants&rdquo; should have
      died in the first four months. It was impossible that scurvy should not
      have been prevalent with both passengers and crew.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S LADING
    </h3>
    <p>
      Beside her human freight of one hundred and thirty or more passengers and
      crew, the lading of the MAY-FLOWER when she sailed from Plymouth
      (England), September 6/16, 1620, was considerable and various. If clearing
      at a custom-house of to-day her manifest would excite no little interest
      and surprise. Taking no account of the ship&rsquo;s stores and supplies
      (necessarily large, like her crew, when bound upon such a voyage, when
      every possible need till her return to her home port must be provided for
      before sailing), the colonists&rsquo; goods and chattels were many, their
      provisions bulky, their ordnance, arms, and stores (in the hold) heavy,
      and their trading-stock fairly ample. Much of the cargo originally stowed
      in the SPEEDWELL, a part, as we know, of her company, and a few of her
      crew were transferred to the MAY-FLOWER at Plymouth, and there can be no
      doubt that the ship was both crowded and overladen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is altogether probable that the crowded condition of her spar and main
      decks caused the supply of live-stock taken&mdash;whether for consumption
      upon the voyage or for the planters&rsquo; needs on shore&mdash;to be very
      limited as to both number and variety. It has been matter of surprise to
      many that no cattle (not even milch-cows) were taken, but if&mdash;as is
      not unlikely&mdash;it was at first proposed to take a cow or two (when
      both ships were to go and larger space was available), this intent was
      undoubtedly abandoned at Plymouth, England, when it became evident that
      there would be dearth of room even for passengers, none whatever for
      cattle or their fodder (a large and prohibitive quantity of the latter
      being required for so long a voyage), and that the lateness of the season
      and its probable hardships would endanger the lives of the animals if
      taken. So far as appears the only domestic live-stock aboard the
      MAY-FLOWER consisted of goats, swine, poultry, and dogs. It is quite
      possible that some few sheep, rabbits, and poultry for immediate
      consumption (these requiring but little forage) may have been shipped,
      this being customary then as now. It is also probable that some household
      pets&mdash;cats and caged singing-birds, the latter always numerous in
      both England and Holland&mdash;were carried on board by their owners,
      though no direct evidence of the fact is found. There is ample proof that
      goats, swine, poultry, and dogs were landed with the colonists at New
      Plymouth, and it is equally certain that they had at first neither cattle,
      horses, nor sheep. Of course the she-goats were their sole reliance for
      milk for some time, whether afloat or ashore, and goat&rsquo;s flesh and pork
      their only possibilities in the way of fresh meat for many months, save
      poultry (and game after landing), though we may be sure, in view of the
      breeding value of their goats, poultry, and swine, few were consumed for
      food. The &ldquo;fresh meat&rdquo; mentioned as placed before Massasoit&rsquo; on his first
      visit was probably venison, though possibly kid&rsquo;s meat, pork, or poultry.
      Of swine and poultry they must have had a pretty fair supply, judging from
      their rapid increase, though their goats must have been few. They were
      wholly without beasts of draft or burden (though it seems strange that a
      few Spanish donkeys or English &ldquo;jacks&rdquo; had not been taken along, as being
      easily kept, hardy, and strong, and quite equal to light ploughing,
      hauling, carrying, etc.), and their lack was sorely felt. The space they
      and their forage demanded it was doubtless considered impracticable to
      spare. The only dogs that appear in evidence are a large mastiff bitch
      (the only dog of that breed probably seen on these shores since Pring&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;bigge dogges&rdquo; so frightened the Indians&rsquo; in this region seventeen years
      before)

     [Captain Martin Pring had at Plymouth, in 1603, two great &ldquo;mastive
     dogges&rdquo; named &ldquo;Fool&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gallant,&rdquo; the former being trained to carry
     a half-pike in his mouth.  &ldquo;The Indians were more afraid of these
     dogs than of twenty men.&rdquo;  American Magazine of History; Goodwin,
     Pilgrim Republic, p. 3.]
</pre>
    <p>
      <br /> and a small spaniel, both the property of passengers, though there
      may have been others not mentioned. Speaking of the venison found in a
      tree by one of the exploring parties, Winslow says: &ldquo;We thought it fitter
      for the dogs than for us,&rdquo; perhaps suggesting by his word &ldquo;the&rdquo; their own
      dogs aboard ship and provision for them. There is an intimation as to the
      ownership of these two dogs in the facts that on certainly two occasions
      John Goodman was accompanied by the little spaniel (once when alone), from
      which it may perhaps be inferred that he was the dog&rsquo;s master; while the
      big mastiffs presence when only Peter Browne and Goodman were together
      suggests that Browne was her owner. The goats, swine, rabbits, and poultry
      were doubtless penned on the spar-deck forward, while possibly some
      poultry, and any sheep brought for food, may have been temporarily housed&mdash;as
      was a practice with early voyagers&mdash;in the (unused) ship&rsquo;s boats,
      though these appear to have been so few in number and so much in demand
      that it is doubtful if they were here available as pens. The heavy cargo
      and most of the lighter was of course stowed in the hold, as the main deck
      (or &ldquo;&lsquo;tween decks&rdquo;) was mostly occupied as quarters for the male
      passengers, old and young, though the colonists&rsquo; shallop, a sloop-rigged
      boat some thirty feet in length, had been &ldquo;cut down&rdquo; and stowed &ldquo;between
      the decks&rdquo; for the voyage. A glimpse of the weary life at sea on that long
      and dreary passage is given in Bradford&rsquo;s remark that &ldquo;she was much opened
      with the people&rsquo;s lying in her during the voyage:&rdquo; This shallop with her
      equipment, a possible spare skiff or two, the chests, &ldquo;boxes,&rdquo; and other
      personal belongings of the passengers, some few cases of goods, some
      furniture, etc., constituted the only freight for which there could have
      been room &ldquo;between decks,&rdquo; most of the space (aft) being occupied by
      cabins and bunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The provisions in use, both by passengers and crew, were probably kept in
      the lazarette or &ldquo;runs,&rdquo; in the stern of the ship, which would be
      unusually capacious in vessels of this model; some&mdash;the bulkiest&mdash;in
      the hold under the forward hatch, as the custom was, and to some extent
      still is. The food supply of the Pilgrims, constituting part of the
      MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S Cargo, included, as appears from authentic sources:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Breadstuff&rsquo;s, including,&mdash;
     Biscuits or ship-bread (in barrels).
     Oatmeal (in barrels or hogsheads).
     Rye meal (in hogsheads).
Butter (in firkins).
Cheese, &ldquo;Hollands&rdquo; and English (in boxes).
Eggs, pickled (in tubs).
Fish, &ldquo;haberdyne&rdquo; [or salt dried cod] (in boxes).
Smoked herring (in boxes).
Meats, including,&mdash;
     Beef, salt, or &ldquo;corned&rdquo; (in barrels).
          Dry-salted (in barrels).
          Smoked (in sacks).
          Dried neats&rsquo;-tongues (in boxes).
     Pork, bacon, smoked (in sacks or boxes).
          Salt [&ldquo;corned&rdquo;] (in barrels).
          Hams and shoulders, smoked (in canvas sacks or hogsheads).
Salt (in bags and barrels).

     Beans (in bags and barrels).
     Cabbages (in sacks and barrels).
     Onions (in sacks).

Beer (in casks), brandy, &ldquo;aqua vitae&rdquo; (in pipes), and gin [&ldquo;Hollands,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;strong waters,&rdquo; or &ldquo;schnapps&rdquo;] (in pipes) were no small or
     unimportant part, from any point of view, of the provision supply.

      Winslow, in his letter to George Morton advising him as to his
      preparations for the voyage over, says: &ldquo;Be careful to have a very good
      bread-room to keep your biscuit in.&rdquo; This was to keep them from dampness.
      Winthrop gives us the memorandum of his order for the ship-bread for his
      voyage in 1630. He says: &ldquo;Agreed with Keene of Southwark, baker, for
      20,000 of Biscuit, 15,000 of brown, and 5,000 of white.&rdquo; Captain Beecher
      minutes: &ldquo;10 M. of bread for the ship ARBELLA.&rdquo; Beecher&rsquo;s memorandum of
      &ldquo;oatmeal&rdquo; is &ldquo;30 bushels.&rdquo; Winslow mentions &ldquo;oatmeal,&rdquo; and Winthrop notes
      among the provisions bought by Captain William Pierce, &ldquo;4 hhds. of
      oatmeal.&rdquo; Rye meal was usually meant by the term &ldquo;meal,&rdquo; and Window in his
      letter to George Morton advises him: &ldquo;Let your meal be so hard-trod in
      your casks that you shall need an adz or hatchet to work it out with;&rdquo; and
      also to &ldquo;be careful to come by [be able to get at] some of your meal to
      spend [use] by the way.&rdquo; Notwithstanding that Bradford&rsquo; speaks of their
      &ldquo;selling away&rdquo; some &ldquo;60 firkins of butter,&rdquo; to clear port charges at
      Southampton, and the leaders, in their letter to the Adventurers from that
      port (August 3), speak of themselves, when leaving Southampton in August,
      1620, as &ldquo;scarce having any butter,&rdquo; there seems to have been some left to
      give as a present to Quadrequina, Massasoit&rsquo;s brother, the last of March
      following, which would indicate its good &ldquo;keeping&rdquo; qualities. Wood, in his
      &ldquo;New England&rsquo;s Prospect&rdquo; (ch. 2), says: &ldquo;Their butter and cheese were
      corrupted.&rdquo; Bradford mentions that their lunch on the exploration
      expedition of November 15, on Cape Cod, included &ldquo;Hollands cheese,&rdquo; which
      receives also other mention. There is a single mention, in the literature
      of the day, of eggs preserved in salt, for use on shipboard. &ldquo;Haberdyne&rdquo;
       (or dried salt cod) seems to have been a favorite and staple article of
      diet aboard ship. Captain Beecher minutes &ldquo;600 haberdyne for the ship
      ARBELLA.&rdquo; Wood says: &ldquo;Their fish was rotten.&rdquo; Smoked &ldquo;red-herring&rdquo; were
      familiar food to all the MAY-FLOWER company. No house or ship of England
      or Holland in that day but made great dependence upon them. Bacon was, of
      course, a main staple at sea. In its half-cooked state as it came from the
      smoke-house it was much relished with their biscuit by seamen and others
      wishing strong food, and when fried it became a desirable article of food
      to all except the sick. Mention is made of it by several of the early
      Pilgrim writers. Carlyle, as quoted, speaks of it as a diet-staple on the
      MAY-FLOWER. Salt (&ldquo;corned&rdquo;) beef has always been a main article of food
      with seamen everywhere. Wood&rsquo; states that the &ldquo;beef&rdquo; of the Pilgrims was
      &ldquo;tainted.&rdquo; In some way it was made the basis of a reputedly palatable
      preparation called &ldquo;spiced beef,&rdquo; mentioned as prepared by one of the
      sailors for a shipmate dying on the MAY-FLOWER in Plymouth harbor. It must
      have been a very different article from that we now find so acceptable
      under that name in England. Winthrop&rsquo; gives the price of his beef at &ldquo;19
      shillings per cwt.&rdquo; Winslow advises his friend Morton, in the letter so
      often quoted, not to have his beef &ldquo;dry-salted,&rdquo; saying, &ldquo;none can do it
      better than the sailors,&rdquo; which is a suggestion not readily understood.
      &ldquo;Smoked&rdquo; beef was practically the same as that known as &ldquo;jerked,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;smoked,&rdquo; or &ldquo;dried&rdquo; beef in America. A &ldquo;dried neat&rsquo;s-tongue&rdquo; is named as
      a contribution of the Pilgrims to the dinner for Captain Jones and his men
      on February 21, 1621, when they had helped to draw up and mount the cannon
      upon the platform on the hill at Plymouth. Winthrop paid &ldquo;14d. a piece&rdquo;
       for his &ldquo;neats&rsquo; tongues.&rdquo; The pork of the Pilgrims is also said by Wood&rsquo;
      to have been &ldquo;tainted.&rdquo; Winthrop states that his pork cost &ldquo;20 pence the
      stone&rdquo; (14 lbs.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Hams seem to have been then, as now, a highly-prized article of diet.
      Goodwin mentions that the salt used by the Pilgrims was (evaporated)
      &ldquo;sea-salt&rdquo; and very &ldquo;impure.&rdquo; Winthrop mentions among his supplies,
      &ldquo;White, Spanish, and Bay salt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The beans of the Pilgrims were probably of the variety then known as
      &ldquo;Spanish beans.&rdquo; The cabbages were apparently boiled with meat, as
      nowadays, and also used considerably for &ldquo;sour-krout&rdquo; and for pickling,
      with which the Leyden people had doubtless become familiar during their
      residence among the Dutch. As anti-scorbutics they were of much value. The
      same was true of onions, whether pickled, salted, raw, or boiled. Turnips
      and parsnips find frequent mention in the early literature of the first
      settlers, and were among their stock vegetables. Pease were evidently
      staple articles of food with the Plymouth people, and are frequently
      named. They probably were chiefly used for porridge and puddings, and were
      used in large quantities, both afloat and ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vinegar in hogsheads was named on the food-list of every ship of the
      Pilgrim era. It was one of their best antiscorbutics, and was of course a
      prime factor in their use of &ldquo;sour krout,&rdquo; pickling, etc. The fruits,
      natural, dried, and preserved, were probably, in that day, in rather small
      supply. Apples, limes, lemons, prunes, olives, rice, etc., were among the
      luxuries of a voyage, while dried or preserved fruits and small fruits
      were not yet in common use. Winslow, in the letter cited, urges that &ldquo;your
      casks for beer . . . be iron bound, at least for the first [end] tyre&rdquo;
       [hoop]. Cushman states that they had ample supplies of beer offered them
      both in Kent and Amsterdam. The planters&rsquo; supply seems to have failed,
      however, soon after the company landed, and they were obliged to rely upon
      the whim of the Captain of the MAY-FLOWER for their needs, the ship&rsquo;s
      supply being apparently separate from that of the planters, and lasting
      longer. Winthrop&rsquo;s supply seems to have been large (&ldquo;42 tons&rdquo;&mdash;probably
      tuns intended). It was evidently a stipulation of the charter-party that
      the ship should, in part at least, provision her crew for the voyage,&mdash;certainly
      furnish their beer. This is rendered certain by Bradford&rsquo;s difficulty (as
      stated by himself) with Captain Jones, previously referred to, showing
      that the ship had her own supply of beer, separate from that of the
      colonists, and that it was intended for the seamen as well as the
      officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradford mentions &ldquo;aqua vitae&rdquo; as a constituent of their lunch on the
      exploring party of November 15. &ldquo;Strong waters&rdquo; (or Holland gin) are
      mentioned as a part of the entertainment given Massasoit on his first
      visit, and they find frequent mention otherwise. Wine finds no mention.
      Bradford states in terms: &ldquo;Neither ever had they any supply of foode from
      them [the Adventurers] but what they first brought with them;&rdquo; and again,
      &ldquo;They never had any supply of vitales more afterwards (but what the Lord
      gave them otherwise), for all ye company [the Adventurers] sent at any
      time was allways too short for those people yt came with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
The clothing supplies of the Pilgrims included hats, caps, shirts,
neck-cloths, jerkins, doublets, waistcoats, breeches (stuff and leather),
&ldquo;hosen,&rdquo; stockings, shoes, boots, belts (girdles), cloth, piece-goods
(dress-stuff&rsquo;s), &ldquo;haberdasherie,&rdquo; etc., etc., all of which, with minor
items for men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s use, find mention in their early narratives,
accounts, and correspondence.  By the will of Mr. Mullens it appears that
he had twenty-one dozen of shoes and thirteen pairs of boots on board,
doubtless intended as medium of exchange or barter.  By the terms of the.
contract with the colonists, the Merchant Adventurers were to supply all
their actual necessities of Clothing food, clothing, etc., for the full
term of seven years, during which the labors of the &ldquo;planters&rdquo; were to be
for the joint account.  Whether under this agreement they were bound to
fully &ldquo;outfit&rdquo; the colonists before they embarked (and did so), as was
done by Higginson&rsquo;s company coming to Salem in 1628-29 at considerable
cost per capita, and as was done for those of the Leyden people who came
over in 1629 with Pierce in the MAY-FLOWER and the TALBOT to Salem, and
again in 1630 with the same Master (Pierce) in the LION by the Plymouth
successors to the Adventurers (without recompense), does not clearly
appear.  No mention is found of any &ldquo;outfitting&rdquo; of the MAY-FLOWER
passengers except the London apprentices.  There is no doubt that a
considerable supply of all the above-named articles was necessarily sent
by the Adventurers on the MAY-FLOWER, both for the Pilgrims&rsquo; needs on the
voyage and in the new colony, as also for trading purposes.  There seems
to have been at all times a supreme anxiety, on the part of both Pilgrim
and Puritan settlers, to get English clothes upon their red brethren of
the forest, whether as a means of exchange for peltry, or for decency&rsquo;s
sake, is not quite clear. There was apparently a greater disparity in
character, intelligence, and station between the leaders of Higginson&rsquo;s
and Winthrop&rsquo;s companies and their followers than between the chief men
of the Pilgrims and their associates.  With the former were titles and
considerable representation of wealth and position.  With the passengers
of the MAY-FLOWER a far greater equality in rank, means, intelligence,
capacity, and character was noticeable.  This was due in part, doubtless,
to the religious beliefs and training of the Leyden contingent, and had
prompt illustration in their Compact, in which all stood at once on an
equal footing.  There was but little of the &ldquo;paternal&rdquo; nature in the form
of their government (though something at times in their punishments), and
there was much personal dignity and independence of the individual.
An equipment having so much of the character of a uniform&mdash;not to say
&ldquo;livery&rdquo;&mdash;as that furnished by Higginson&rsquo;s company to its people
suggests the &ldquo;hedger and ditcher&rdquo; type of colonists (of whom there were
very few among the Plymouth settlers), rather than the scholar,
publisher, tradesman, physician, hatter, smith, carpenter, &ldquo;lay reader,&rdquo;
 and soldier of the Pilgrims, and would certainly have been obnoxious to
their finer sense of personal dignity and proportion.  Doubtless an
equivalent provision existed&mdash;though in less &ldquo;all-of-a-pattern&rdquo;
 character&mdash;in the bales and boxes of the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S cargo for every
need suggested by the list of the Higginson &ldquo;outfit,&rdquo; which is given
herewith, both as matter of interest and as affording an excellent idea
of the accepted style and needs in dress of a New England settler (at
least of the men) of 1620-30.  One cannot fail to wonder at the
noticeably infrequent mention of provision in apparel, etc., for the
women and children. The inventory of the &ldquo;Apparell for 100 men&rdquo; furnished
by Higginson&rsquo;s company in 1628-29 gives us, among others, the following
items of clothing for each emigrant:&mdash;
4 &ldquo;peares of shoes.&rdquo;
 4 &ldquo;peares of stockings.&rdquo;
 1 &ldquo;peare Norwich gaiters.&rdquo;
 4 &ldquo;shirts.&rdquo;
 2 &ldquo;suits dublet and hose of leather lyn&rsquo;d with oyld skyn leather, ye hose
     &amp; dublett with hooks &amp; eyes.&rdquo;
 1 &ldquo;sute of Norden dussens or hampshire kersies lynd the hose with skins,
dublets with lynen of gilford or gedlyman kerseys.&rdquo;
 4  bands.
2 handkerchiefs.
1 &ldquo;wastecoat of greene cotton bound about with red tape.&rdquo;
 1 leather girdle.
1 &ldquo;Monmouth cap.&rdquo;
 1 &ldquo;black hatt lyned in the brows with lether.&rdquo;
 5 &ldquo;Red knitt capps milf&rsquo;d about 5d apiece.&rdquo;
 2 &ldquo;peares of gloves.&rdquo;
 1 &ldquo;Mandiliion lynd with cotton&rdquo; [mantle or greatcoat].
1 &ldquo;peare of breeches and waistcoat.&rdquo;
 1 &ldquo;leather sute of Dublett &amp; breeches of oyled leather.&rdquo;
 1 &ldquo;peare of leather breeches and drawers to weare with both there other
sutes.&rdquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
In 1628 Josselyn put the average cost of clothing to emigrants to New
England at L4 each.  In 1629 good shoes cost the &ldquo;Bay&rdquo; colonists 2s/7d
per pair.  In his &ldquo;Two Voyages to New England&rdquo; previously referred to,
Josselyn gives an estimate (made about 1628) of the &ldquo;outfit&rdquo; in clothing
needed by a New England settler of his time.  He names as &ldquo;Apparel for
one man&mdash;and after this rate for more:&mdash;&rdquo;
           One Hatt
          One Monmouth Cap
          Three falling bands
          Three Shirts
          One Wastcoat
          One Suite of Frize (Frieze)
          One Suite of Cloth
          One Suite of Canvas
          Three Pairs of Irish Stockings
          Four Pairs of Shoes
          One Pair of Canvas Sheets
          Seven ells of coarse canvas, to make a bed at sea for two men,
               to be filled with straw
          One Coarse Rug at Sea

      The Furniture of the Pilgrims has naturally been matter of much interest
      to their descendants and others for many years. While it is doubtful if a
      single article now in existence can be positively identified and
      truthfully certified as having made the memorable voyage in the MAY-FLOWER
      (nearly everything having, of course, gone to decay with the wear and tear
      of more than two hundred and fifty years), this honorable origin is still
      assigned to many heirlooms, to some probably correctly. Dr. Oliver Wendell
      Holmes in his delightful lines, &ldquo;On Lending a Punch Bowl,&rdquo; humorously
      claims for his convivial silver vessel a place with the Pilgrims:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         &ldquo;Along with all the furniture, to fill their new abodes,
          To judge by what is still on hand, at least a hundred loads.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      To a very few time-worn and venerated relics&mdash;such as Brewster&rsquo;s
      chair and one or more books, Myles Standish&rsquo;s Plymouth sword, the
      Peregrine White cradle, Winslow&rsquo;s pewter, and one or two of Bradford&rsquo;s
      books&mdash;a strong probability attaches that they were in veritate, as
      traditionally avowed, part of the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S freight, but of even these
      the fact cannot be proven beyond the possibility of a doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      From its pattern and workmanship, which are of a period antedating the
      &ldquo;departure from Delfshaven,&rdquo; and the ancient tradition which is traceable
      to Brewster&rsquo;s time, it appears altogether probable that what is known as
      &ldquo;Elder Brewster&rsquo;s chair&rdquo; came with him on the ship. There is even greater
      probability as to one of his books bearing his autograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sword of Myles Standish, in possession of the Pilgrim Society, may
      claim, with equal probability, MAY-FLOWER relation, from its evident
      antiquity and the facts that, as a soldier, his trusty blade doubtless
      stayed with him, and that it is directly traceable in his descendants&rsquo;
      hands, back to his time; but an equally positive claim is made for similar
      honors for another sword said to have also belonged to the Captain, now in
      the keeping of the Massachusetts Historical Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Peregrine White cradle &ldquo;is strongly indorsed as of the MAY-FLOWER,
      from the facts that it is, indubitably, of a very early Dutch pattern and
      manufacture; that Mrs. White was anticipating the early need of a cradle
      when leaving Holland; and that the descent of this one as an heirloom in
      her (second) family is so fairly traced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pewter and the silver flask of Winslow not only bear very early
      &ldquo;Hallmarks,&rdquo; but also the arms of his family, which it is not likely he
      would have had engraved on what he may have bought after notably becoming
      the defender of the simplicity and democracy of the &ldquo;Pilgrim Republic.&rdquo;
       Long traceable use in his family strengthens belief in the supposition
      that these articles came with the Pilgrims, and were then very probably
      heirlooms. One of Governor Bradford&rsquo;s books (Pastor John Robinson&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;Justification of Separation&rdquo;), published in 1610, and containing the
      Governor&rsquo;s autograph, bears almost &lsquo;prima facie&rsquo; evidence of having come
      with him in the MAY-FLOWER, but of course might, like the above-named
      relics, have come in some later ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this connection it is of interest to note what freight the MAY-FLOWER
      carried for the intellectual needs of the Pilgrims. Of Bibles, as the
      &ldquo;book of books,&rdquo; we may be sure&mdash;even without the evidence of the
      inventories of the early dead&mdash;there was no lack, and there is reason
      to believe that they existed in several tongues, viz. in English, Dutch,
      and possibly French (the Walloon contribution from the Huguenots), while
      there is little doubt that, alike as publishers and as &ldquo;students of the
      Word,&rdquo; Brewster, Bradford, and Winslow, at least, were possessed of, and
      more or less familiar with, both the Latin and Greek Testaments. It is
      altogether probable, however, that Governor Bradford&rsquo;s well attested study
      of &ldquo;the oracles of God in the original&rdquo; Hebrew, and his possession of the
      essential Hebrew Bible, grammar, and lexicon, were of a later day. Some
      few copies of the earliest hymnals (&ldquo;psalme-bookes&rdquo;)&mdash;then very
      limited in number&mdash;there is evidence that the Holland voyagers had
      with them in the singing of their parting hymns at Leyden and Delfshaven,
      as mentioned by Winslow and in the earlier inventories: These metrical
      versions of the Psalms constituted at the time, practically, the only
      hymnology permitted in the worship of the &ldquo;Separatists,&rdquo; though the grand
      hymn of Luther, &ldquo;Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott,&rdquo; doubtless familiar to
      them, must have commended itself as especially comforting and apposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the doctrinal tracts of their beloved Pastor, John Robinson, there is
      every probability, as well as some proof, that there was good supply, as
      well as those of Ainsworth and Clyfton and of the works of William Ames,
      the renowned Franeker Professor, the controversial opponent but sincere
      friend of Robinson: the founder of evangelical &ldquo;systematic theology,&rdquo;
       [method&mdash;Methodist? D.W.] whom death alone prevented from becoming
      the President of Harvard College. We may be equally sure that the few
      cases of books in the freight of the Pilgrim ship included copies of the
      publications of the &ldquo;hidden and hunted press&rdquo; of Brewster and Brewer, and
      some at least of the issues of their fellows in tribulation at Amsterdam
      and in Scotland and England. Some few heavy tomes and early classics in
      English, Dutch, Latin, and Greek were also presumably among the goodly
      number of books brought in the MAY FLOWER by Brewster, Bradford, Winslow,
      Fuller, Hopkins, Allerton, Standish, and others, though it is probable
      that the larger part of the very considerable library of four hundred
      volumes, left at his death by Brewster (including sixty-two in Latin), and
      of the respectable libraries of Fuller, Standish, and others, named in
      their respective inventories, either were brought over in the later ships,
      or were the products of the earliest printers of New England. One is
      surprised and amused that the library of the good Dr. Fuller should
      contain so relatively small a proportion of medical works (although the
      number in print prior to his death in 1633 was not great), while rich in
      religious works pertinent to his functions as deacon. It is equally
      interesting to note that the inventory of the soldier Standish should name
      only one book on military science, &ldquo;Bariffe&rsquo;s Artillery,&rdquo; though it
      includes abundant evidence to controvert, beyond reasonable doubt, the
      suggestion which has been made, that he was of the Romanist faith. Just
      which of the books left by the worthies named, and others whose
      inventories we possess, came with them in the Pilgrim ship, cannot be
      certainly determined, though, as before noted, some still in existence
      bear intrinsic testimony that they were of the number. There is evidence
      that Allerton made gift of a book to Giles Heale of the MAY-FLOWER
      (perhaps the ship&rsquo;s surgeon), while the ship lay at Plymouth, and Francis
      Cooke&rsquo;s inventory includes &ldquo;1 great Bible and 4 olde bookes,&rdquo; which as
      they were &ldquo;olde,&rdquo; and he was clearly not a book-buyer, very probably came
      with him in the ship. In fact, hardly an adult of the Leyden colonists,
      the inventory of whose estate at death we possess, but left one or more
      books which may have been his companions on the voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the early forms of British and Dutch calendars, &ldquo;annuals,&rdquo; and
      agricultural &ldquo;hand-books,&rdquo; it is certain were brought over by several
      families, and were doubtless much consulted and well-thumbed &ldquo;guides,
      counsellors, and friends&rdquo; in the households of their possessors. The great
      preponderance of reading matter brought by the little colony was, however,
      unquestionably of the religious controversial order, which had been so
      much a part of their lives, and its sum total was considerable. There are
      intimations, in the inventories of the Fathers, of a few works of
      historical cast, but of these not many had yet been printed. &ldquo;Caesar&rsquo;s
      Commentaries,&rdquo; a &ldquo;History of the World,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;History of Turkey&rdquo; on
      Standish&rsquo;s shelves, with the two Dictionaries and &ldquo;Peter Martyr on Rome&rdquo;
       on Dr. Fuller&rsquo;s, were as likely to have come in the first ship, and to
      have afforded as much satisfaction to the hungry readers of the little
      community as any of the books we find named in the lists of their little
      stock. It is pathetic to note, in these days of utmost prodigality in
      juvenile literature, that for the Pilgrim children, aside from the &ldquo;Bible
      stories,&rdquo; some of the wonderful and mirth-provoking metrical renderings of
      the &ldquo;Psalme booke,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;horne booke,&rdquo; or primer (the alphabet and
      certain elementary contributions in verse or prose, placed between thin
      covers of transparent horn for protection), there was almost absolutely
      nothing in the meagre book-freight of the Pilgrim ark. &ldquo;Milk for Babes,&rdquo;
       whether as physical or mental pabulum, was in poor supply aboard the
      MAY-FLOWER.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most that can be claimed with confidence, for particular objects of
      alleged MAY-FLOWER relation, is that there is logical and moral certainty
      that there was a supply of just such things on board, because they were
      indispensable, and because every known circumstance and condition
      indicates their presence in the hands to which they are assigned, while
      tradition and collateral evidence confirm the inference and sometimes go
      very far to establish their alleged identity, and their presence with
      their respective owners upon the ship. A few other articles besides those
      enumerated in possession of the Pilgrim Society, and of other societies
      and individuals, present almost equally strong claims with those named, to
      be counted as &ldquo;of MAY-FLOWER belonging,&rdquo; but in no case is the connection
      entirely beyond question. Where so competent, interested, and
      conscientious students of Pilgrim history as Hon. William T. Davis, of
      Plymouth, and the late Dr. Thomas B. Drew, so long the curator of the
      Pilgrim Society, cannot find warrant for a positive claim in behalf of any
      article as having come, beyond a doubt, &ldquo;in the MAY FLOWER,&rdquo; others may
      well hesitate to insist upon that which, however probable and desirable,
      is not susceptible of conclusive proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      That certain articles of household furniture, whether now existent or not,
      were included in the ship&rsquo;s cargo, is attested by the inventories of the
      small estates of those first deceased, and, by mention or implication, in
      the narratives of Bradford, Winslow, Morton, and other contemporaries, as
      were also many utensils and articles of domestic use. There were also
      beyond question many not so mentioned, which may be safely named as having
      very certainly been comprised in the ship&rsquo;s lading, either because in
      themselves indispensable to the colonists, or because from the evidence in
      hand we know them to have been inseparable from the character, social
      status, daily habits, home life, or ascertained deeds of the Pilgrims.
      When it is remembered that furnishings, however simple, were speedily
      required for no less than nineteen &ldquo;cottages&rdquo; and their households, the
      sum total called for was not inconsiderable.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [Bradford, in Mourt&rsquo;s Relation (p. 68), shows that the colonists
     were divided up into &ldquo;nineteen families,&rdquo; that &ldquo;so we might build
     fewer houses.&rdquo;  Winslow, writing to George Morton, December 11/21,
     1621, says: &ldquo;We have built seven dwelling-houses and four for the
     use of the plantation.&rdquo;  Bradford (Historie, Mass.  ed.  p. 110)
     calls the houses &ldquo;small cottages.&rdquo;]
</pre>
    <p>
      Among the furniture for these &ldquo;cottages&rdquo; brought on the Pilgrim ship may
      be enumerated: chairs, table-chairs, stools and forms (benches), tables of
      several sizes and shapes (mostly small), table-boards and &ldquo;cloathes,&rdquo;
       trestles, beds; bedding and bed-clothing, cradles, &ldquo;buffets,&rdquo; cupboards
      and &ldquo;cabinets,&rdquo; chests and chests of drawers, boxes of several kinds and
      &ldquo;trunks,&rdquo; andirons, &ldquo;iron dogs,&rdquo; &ldquo;cob-irons,&rdquo; fire-tongs and &ldquo;slices&rdquo;
       (shovels), cushions, rugs, and &ldquo;blanckets,&rdquo; spinning wheels, hand-looms,
      etc., etc. Among household utensils were &ldquo;spits,&rdquo; &ldquo;bake-kettles,&rdquo; pots and
      kettles (iron, brass, and copper), frying-pans, &ldquo;mortars&rdquo; and pestles
      (iron, brass, and &ldquo;belle-mettle&rdquo;), sconces, lamps (oil &ldquo;bettys&rdquo;),
      candlesticks, snuffers, buckets, tubs, &ldquo;runlets,&rdquo; pails and baskets,
      &ldquo;steel yards,&rdquo; measures, hour-glasses and sun-dials, pewter-ware
      (platters, plates, mugs, porringers, etc.), wooden trenchers, trays,
      &ldquo;noggins,&rdquo; &ldquo;bottles,&rdquo; cups, and &ldquo;lossets.&rdquo; Earthen ware, &ldquo;fatten&rdquo; ware
      (mugs, &ldquo;jugs,&rdquo; and &ldquo;crocks &ldquo;), leather ware (bottles, &ldquo;noggins,&rdquo; and
      cups), table-ware (salt &ldquo;sellars,&rdquo; spoons, knives, etc), etc. All of the
      foregoing, with numerous lesser articles, have received mention in the
      early literature of the Pilgrim exodus, and were undeniably part of the
      MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S lading.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MAY-FLOWER origin claimed for the &ldquo;Governor Carver chair&rdquo; and the
      &ldquo;Elder Brewster chair&rdquo; rests wholly upon tradition, and upon the venerable
      pattern and aspect of the chairs themselves. The &ldquo;Winslow chair,&rdquo; in
      possession of the Pilgrim Society at Plymouth (Mass.), though bearing
      evidence of having been &ldquo;made in Cheapside, London, in 1614,&rdquo; is not
      positively known to have been brought on the MAY-FLOWER. Thacher&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;History of Plymouth&rdquo; (p. 144.) states that &ldquo;a sitting-chair, said to have
      been screwed to the floor of the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S cabin for the convenience of
      a lady, is known to have been in the possession of Penelope Winslow (who
      married James Warren), and is now in possession of Hannah White.&rdquo; There
      are certain venerable chairs alleged, with some show of probability, to
      have been the property of Captain Standish, now owned in Bridgewater, but
      there is no record attached to them, and they are not surely assignable to
      either ship or owner. That some few tables &mdash;mostly small&mdash;were
      brought in the MAY-FLOWER, there is some evidence, but the indications are
      that what were known as &ldquo;table-boards&rdquo;&mdash;long and narrow boards
      covered with what were called &ldquo;board-cloths&rdquo;&mdash;very largely took the
      place of tables. The walnut-top table, said to have once been Governor
      Winslow&rsquo;s and now in possession of the Pilgrim Society, is not known to
      have come over with him, and probably did not. It was very likely bought
      for the use of the Council when he was governor. The &ldquo;table-boards&rdquo;
       mentioned were laid on &ldquo;trestles&rdquo; (cross-legged and folding supports of
      proper height), which had the great merit that they could be placed in any
      convenient spot and as easily folded up, and with the board put away,
      leaving the space which a table would have permanently occupied free for
      other use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradford mentions that when the fire of Sunday, January 14., 1621,
      occurred in the &ldquo;common house,&rdquo; the &ldquo;house was as full of beds as they
      could lie one by another.&rdquo; There is a doubt, however, whether this
      indicates bedsteads or (probably) &ldquo;pallets&rdquo; only. Beds, bedding of all
      sorts, pillow-&ldquo;beers,&rdquo; pillow-cases and even &ldquo;mattrises,&rdquo; are of most
      frequent mention in the earliest wills and inventories. (See Appendix.)
      &ldquo;Buffets,&rdquo; &ldquo;cupboards,&rdquo; and &ldquo;cabinets,&rdquo; all find mention in the earliest
      writers and inventories, and one or two specimens, for which a MAY-FLOWER
      history is claimed, are in possession of the Pilgrim Society and others.
      The &ldquo;White&rdquo; cabinet, of putative MAY-FLOWER connection, owned by the
      Pilgrim Society, is a fine example of its class, and both its &ldquo;ear marks&rdquo;
       and its known history support the probable truth of the claim made for it.
      Of &ldquo;chests&rdquo; and &ldquo;chests-of-drawers&rdquo; there were doubtless goodly numbers in
      the ship, but with the exception of a few chests (or the fragments of
      them), for which a MAY-FLOWER passage is vaunted, little is known of them.
      The chest claimed to be that of Elder Brewster, owned by the Connecticut
      Historical Society, was not improb ably his, but that it had any
      MAY-FLOWER relation is not shown. A fragment of a chest claimed to have
      been &ldquo;brought by Edward Winslow in the MAY-FLOWER&rdquo; is owned by the Pilgrim
      Society, and bears considerable evidence of the probable validity of such
      claim, but proof positive is lacking. Boxes of several kinds and sizes
      were part of the Pilgrims&rsquo; chattels on their ship, some of them taking the
      place of the travellers&rsquo; &ldquo;trunks&rdquo; of to-day, though &ldquo;trunks&rdquo; were then
      known by that name and find early mention in Pilgrim inventories, and
      there were no doubt some upon the Pilgrim ship. A few claiming such
      distinction are exhibited, but without attested records of their origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Andirons, fire-dogs, and cob-irons&rdquo; (the latter to rest roasting spits
      upon) were enumerated among the effects of those early deceased among the
      Pilgrims, rendering it well-certain that they must have been part of their
      belongings on the MAY-FLOWER. Fire-tongs and &ldquo;slices&rdquo; [shovels] are also
      frequently mentioned in early Pilgrim inventories, placing them in the
      same category with the &ldquo;andirons and fire-dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In &ldquo;Mourt&rsquo;s Relation,&rdquo; in the accounts given of the state reception of
      Massasoit, &ldquo;a green rug and three or four cushions&rdquo; are shown to have
      performed their parts in the official ceremonies, and were, of course,
      necessarily brought in the MAY-FLOWER.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spinning-wheels and hand-looms were such absolute necessities, and were so
      familiar and omnipresent features of the lives and labors of the Pilgrim
      housewives and their Dutch neighbors of Leyden, that we should be certain
      that they came with the Pilgrims, even if they did not find mention in the
      earliest Pilgrim inventories. Many ancient ones are exhibited in the &ldquo;Old
      Colony,&rdquo; but it is not known that it is claimed for any of them that they
      came in the first ship. It is probable that some of the &ldquo;cheese fatts&rdquo; and
      churns so often named in early inventories came in the ship, though at
      first there was, in the absence of milch kine, no such use for them as
      there had been in both England and Holland, and soon was in New England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among cooking utensils the roasting &ldquo;spit&rdquo; was, in one form or another,
      among the earliest devices for cooking flesh, and as such was an essential
      of every household. Those brought by the Plymouth settlers were probably,
      as indicated by the oldest specimens that remain to us, of a pretty
      primitive type. The ancient &ldquo;bake-kettle&rdquo; (sometimes called &ldquo;pan&rdquo;), made
      to bury in the ashes and thus to heat above and below, has never been
      superseded where resort must be had to the open fire for cooking, and
      (practically unchanged) is in use to-day at many a sheep-herder&rsquo;s and
      cowboy&rsquo;s camp fire of the Far West. We may be sure that it was in every
      MAY-FLOWER family, and occasional ancient specimens are yet to be found in
      &ldquo;Old Colony&rdquo; garrets. Pots and kettles of all sorts find more frequent
      mention in the early inventories than anything else, except muskets and
      swords, and were probably more numerous upon the ship than any other
      cooking utensil. A few claimed to be from the Pilgrim ship are exhibited,
      chief of which is a large iron pot, said to have been &ldquo;brought by Myles
      Standish in the MAY-FLOWER,&rdquo; now owned by the Pilgrim Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly an early Pilgrim inventory but includes &ldquo;a mortar and pestle,&rdquo;
       sometimes of iron, sometimes of &ldquo;brass&rdquo; or &ldquo;belle-mettle&rdquo; (bell metal).
      They were of course, in the absence of mills, and for some purposes for
      which small hand mills were not adapted, prime necessities, and every
      house hold had one. A very fine one of brass (with an iron pestle), nine
      and a half inches across its bell-shaped top,&mdash;exhibited by the
      Pilgrim Society, and said to have been &ldquo;brought in the MAY-FLOWER by
      Edward Winslow,&rdquo;&mdash;seems to the author as likely to have been so as
      almost any article for which that distinction is claimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lighting facilities of the Pilgrims were fewer and cruder than those
      for cooking. They possessed the lamp of the ancient Romans, Greeks, and
      Hebrews, with but few improvements,&mdash;a more or less fanciful vessel
      for oil, with a protuberant nose for a wick, and a loose-twisted cotton
      wick. Hand-lamps of this general form and of various devices, called
      &ldquo;betty-lamps,&rdquo; were commonly used, with candlesticks of various metals,
      &mdash;iron, brass, silver, and copper,&mdash;though but few of any other
      ware. For wall-lighting two or more candle sockets were brought together
      in &ldquo;sconces,&rdquo; which were more or less elaborate in design and finish. One
      of the early writers (Higginson) mentions the abundance of oil (from fish)
      available for lamps, but all tallow and suet used by the early colonists
      was, for some years (till cattle became plentiful), necessarily imported.
      Some of the &ldquo;candle-snuffers&rdquo; of the &ldquo;first comers&rdquo; doubtless still
      remain. We may be sure every family had its candles, &ldquo;betty-lamps,&rdquo;
       candlesticks, and &ldquo;snuffers.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lanthorns&rdquo; were of the primitive,
      perforated tin variety&mdash;only &ldquo;serving to make darkness visible&rdquo; now
      found in a few old attics in Pilgrim towns, and on the &ldquo;bull-carts&rdquo; of the
      peons of Porto Rico, by night. Fire, for any purpose, was chiefly procured
      by the use of flint, steel, and tinder, of which many very early specimens
      exist. Buckets, tubs, and pails were, beyond question, numerous aboard the
      ship, and were among the most essential and highly valued of Pilgrim
      utensils. Most, if not all of them, we may confidently assert, were
      brought into requisition on that Monday &ldquo;wash-day&rdquo; at Cape Cod, the first
      week-day after their arrival, when the women went ashore to do their
      long-neglected laundrying, in the comparatively fresh water of the beach
      pond at Cape Cod harbor. They are frequently named in the earliest
      inventories. Bradford also mentions the filling of a &ldquo;runlet&rdquo; with water
      at the Cape. The &ldquo;steel-yards&rdquo; and &ldquo;measures&rdquo; were the only determiners of
      weight and quantity&mdash;as the hour-glass and sun dial were of time&mdash;possessed
      at first (so far as appears) by the passengers of the Pilgrim ship, though
      it is barely possible that a Dutch clock or two may have been among the
      possessions of the wealthiest. Clocks and watches were not yet in common
      use (though the former were known in England from 1540), and except that
      in &ldquo;Mourt&rsquo;s Relation&rdquo; and Bradford&rsquo;s &ldquo;Historie&rdquo; mention is made of the
      time of day as such &ldquo;o&rsquo;clock&rdquo; (indicating some degree of familiarity with
      clocks), no mention is made of their possession at the first. Certain of
      the leaders were apparently acquainted at Leyden with the astronomer
      Galileo, co-resident with them there, and through this acquaintance some
      of the wealthier and more scholarly may have come to know, and even to
      own, one of the earliest Dutch clocks made with the pendulum invented by
      Galileo, though hardly probable as early as 1620. Pocket watches were yet
      practically unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except for a few pieces of silver owned by the wealthiest of their number,
      pewter was the most elegant and expensive of the Pilgrims&rsquo; table-ware. A
      pewter platter said to have been &ldquo;brought over in the MAY-FLOWER&rdquo; is now
      owned by the Pilgrim Society, which also exhibits smaller pewter formerly
      Edward Winslow&rsquo;s, and bearing his &ldquo;arms,&rdquo; for which, as previously noted,
      a like claim is made. Platters, dishes, &ldquo;potts,&rdquo; ladles, bottles,
      &ldquo;flaggons,&rdquo; &ldquo;skelletts,&rdquo; cups, porringers, &ldquo;basons,&rdquo; spoons, candlesticks,
      and salt &ldquo;sellars,&rdquo; were among the many pewter utensils unmistakably
      brought on the good ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wooden-ware of the colonists, brought with them, was considerable and
      various. The Dutch were long famous for its fabrication. There was but
      very little china, glass, or pottery of any kind in common use in western
      Europe in 1620; some kinds were not yet made, and pewter, wood, and
      leather largely filled their places. Wooden trenchers (taking the place of
      plates), trays, &ldquo;noggins&rdquo; (jug or pitcher-like cups), cups, and &ldquo;lossets&rdquo;
       (flat dishes like the bread-plates of to day), were of course part of
      every housewife&rsquo;s providings. Some few of Pilgrim origin possibly still
      exist. As neither coffee, tea, nor china had come into use, the cups and
      saucers which another century brought in&mdash;to delight their owners in
      that day and the ceramic hunter in this&mdash;were not among the
      &ldquo;breakables&rdquo; of the &ldquo;good-wife&rdquo; of the MAY-FLOWER. The &ldquo;table-plenishings&rdquo;
       had not much variety, but in the aggregate the (first) &ldquo;nineteen families&rdquo;
       must have required quite a quantity of spoons, knives, salt &ldquo;sellars,&rdquo;
       etc. Forks there were none, and of the accessories of to-day (except
      napkins), very few. Meat was held by the napkin while being cut with the
      knife. Josselyn&rsquo; gives a list of &ldquo;Implements for a family of six persons&rdquo;
       going to New England.

      Among the implements of husbandry, etc., and mechanics&rsquo; tools we find
      evidence of hoes, spades, shovels, scythes, &ldquo;sikles,&rdquo; mattocks,
      bill-hooks, garden-rakes, hay-forks (&ldquo;pitch-forks&rdquo;), besides seed-grain
      and garden seeds. Axes, saws, hammers, &ldquo;adzs,&rdquo; augers, chisels, gouges,
      squares, hatchets, an &ldquo;iron jack-scrue,&rdquo; &ldquo;holdfasts&rdquo; (vises), blacksmiths&rsquo;
      tools, coopers&rsquo; tools, iron and steel in bar, anvils, chains, etc.,
      &ldquo;staples and locks,&rdquo; rope, lime (for mortar), nails, etc., are also known
      to have been in the ship. Francis Eaton, the carpenter, seems to have had
      a very respectable &ldquo;kit,&rdquo; and Fletcher, the smith, was evidently fairly
      &ldquo;outfitted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The implements of husbandry were of the lighter (?) sort; no ploughs,
      harrows, carts, harness, stone-drags, or other farming tools requiring the
      strength of beasts for their use, were included. In nothing could they
      have experienced so sharp a contrast as in the absence of horses, cattle,
      and sheep in their husbandry, and especially of milch kine. Bradford and
      Window both mention hoes, spades, mattocks, and sickles, while shovels,
      scythes, bill-hooks (brush-scythes, the terrible weapons of the English
      peasantry in their great &ldquo;Mon mouth&rdquo; and earlier uprisings), pitchforks,
      etc., find very early mention in inventories and colonial records.
      Josselyn, in his &ldquo;Two Voyages to New England,&rdquo; gives, in 1628, the
      following very pertinent list of &ldquo;Tools for a Family of six persons, and
      so after this rate for more,&mdash;intending for New England.&rdquo; This may be
      taken as fairly approximating the possessions of the average MAY-FLOWER
      planter, though probably somewhat exceeding individual supplies. Eight
      years of the Pilgrims&rsquo; experience had taught those who came after them
      very much that was of service.

      Unhappily we know little from contemporaneous authority as to what grain
      and other seeds the Pilgrims brought with them for planting. We may be
      sure, however, that rye, barley, oats, wheat, pease, and beans were the
      bulkiest of this part of their freight, though Bradford mentions the
      planting of &ldquo;garden seeds&rdquo; their first spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we know from the earliest Pilgrim chronicles that their mechanics&rsquo;
      implements embraced axes, saws, hammers, &ldquo;adzs,&rdquo; augers, hatchets, an
      &ldquo;iron jack-scrue,&rdquo; &ldquo;staples and locks,&rdquo; etc., we know there must have been
      many other tools not mentioned by them, brought over with the settlers.
      The &ldquo;great iron-scrue,&rdquo; as Bradford calls it in his original MS., played,
      as all know, a most important part on the voyage, in forcing the &ldquo;cracked
      and bowed&rdquo; deck-beam of the ship into place. Governor Bradford tells us
      that &ldquo;it was brought on board by one of the Leyden passengers,&rdquo; and one
      may hazard the guess that it was by either Moses Fletcher, the smith, or
      Francis Eaton, the &ldquo;carpenter.&rdquo; &ldquo;Staples&rdquo; and &ldquo;locks&rdquo; found their place
      and mention, as well as the &ldquo;chains,&rdquo; &ldquo;manacles,&rdquo; and &ldquo;leg-irons&rdquo; named in
      the list of accoutrements for offence or defence, when it became necessary
      to chain up the Indian spy of the Neponsets (as narrated by Winslow in his
      &ldquo;Good Newes from New England&rdquo;) and other evil-doers. The planters seem to
      have made stiff &ldquo;mortar,&rdquo; which premises the use of lime and indicates a
      supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the fishing and fowling implements of the MAY FLOWER colonists are
      recorded, nets, &ldquo;seynes,&rdquo; twine, fish hooks, muskets (for large game),
      &ldquo;fowling pieces,&rdquo; powder, &ldquo;goose-shot,&rdquo; &ldquo;hail-shot,&rdquo; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such early mention is found of the nets, &ldquo;seynes,&rdquo; etc., of their fishing
      equipment, as to leave no room for doubt that store of them was brought in
      the ship. They seem to have been unfortunate in the size of their
      fish-hooks, which are spoken of as &ldquo;too large&rdquo; even for cod. They must, as
      Goodwin remarks, &ldquo;have been very large.&rdquo; Window also says, &ldquo;We wanted fit
      and strong seines and other netting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They seem to have relied upon their muskets to some extent for wild fowl
      (as witness Winslow&rsquo;s long and successful shot at a duck, on his visit to
      Massasoit), as they undoubtedly did for deer, etc. They were apparently
      fairly well supplied with them, of either the &ldquo;matchlock&rdquo; or &ldquo;snaphance&rdquo;
       (flintlock) pattern, though the planters complained to the Merchant
      Adventurers (in their letter of August 3, from Southampton), that they
      were &ldquo;wanting many muskets,&rdquo; etc. That they had some &ldquo;fowling-pieces&rdquo; is
      shown by the fact that young Billington seems (according to Bradford) to
      have &ldquo;shot one off in his father&rsquo;s cabin&rdquo; aboard ship in Cape Cod harbor,
      and there are several other coeval mentions of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arms and accoutrements (besides ordnance) of the MAY-FLOWER Pilgrims,
      known on the authority of Bradford and Winslow to have been brought by
      them, included muskets (&ldquo;matchlocks&rdquo;), &ldquo;snaphances&rdquo; (flintlocks), armor
      (&ldquo;corslets,&rdquo; &ldquo;cuirasses,&rdquo; &ldquo;helmets,&rdquo; &ldquo;bandoliers,&rdquo; etc.), swords,
      &ldquo;curtlaxes&rdquo; (cutlasses), &ldquo;daggers,&rdquo; powder, &ldquo;mould-shot,&rdquo; &ldquo;match&rdquo;
       (slow-match for guns), &ldquo;flints,&rdquo; belts, &ldquo;knapsacks,&rdquo; &ldquo;drum,&rdquo; &ldquo;trumpet,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;manacles,&rdquo; &ldquo;leg-irons,&rdquo; etc., etc. &ldquo;Pistols&rdquo; (brass) appear in early
      inventories, but their absence in the early hand-to-hand encounter at
      Wessagussett indicates that none were then available, or that they were
      not trusted. It is evident from the statement of Bradford that every one
      of the sixteen men who went out (under command of Standish) on the &ldquo;first
      exploration&rdquo; at Cape Cod had his &ldquo;musket, sword, and corslet;&rdquo; that they
      relied much on their armor, and hence, doubtless, took all possible with
      them on the ship. They probably did not long retain its use. In the letter
      written to the Adventurers from Southampton, the leaders complain of
      &ldquo;wanting many muskets, much armour, &amp;c.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Josselyn gives&rsquo; the equipment he considers necessary for each man going to
      New England to settle:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Armor compleat:&mdash;
     One long piece [musket] five feet or five and a half long.
     One Sword.
     One bandoleer.
     One belt.
     Twenty pounds of powder.
     Sixty pounds of shot or lead, pistol and Goose-shot.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Another list gives an idea of &lsquo;complete armor.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      Corselet
     Breast [plate or piece].
     Back [ditto].
     Culet (?).
     Gorget [throat-piece].
     Tussis [thigh-pieces].
     Head-piece &ldquo;[morion skull-cap].&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Bradford states that they used their &ldquo;curtlaxes&rdquo; (cutlasses) to dig the
      frozen ground to get at the Indians&rsquo; corn, &ldquo;having forgotten to bring
      spade or mattock.&rdquo; &ldquo;Daggers&rdquo; are mentioned as used in their celebrated
      duel by Dotey and Leister, servants of Stephen Hopkins. Bradford narrates
      that on one of their exploring tours on the Cape the length of guard duty
      performed at night by each &ldquo;relief&rdquo; was determined by the inches of
      slow-match burned (&ldquo;every one standing when his turn came while five or
      six inches of match was burning&rdquo;), clearly indicating that they had no
      watches with them. The &ldquo;drum&rdquo; and &ldquo;trumpet&rdquo; are both mentioned in &ldquo;Mourt&rsquo;s
      Relation&rdquo; in the account given of Massasoit&rsquo;s reception, the latter as
      eliciting the especial attention of his men, and their efforts at blowing
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ordnance (cannon) brought in the ship consisted (probably) of ten
      guns, certainly of six. Of these, two (2) were &ldquo;sakers,&rdquo;&mdash;guns ten
      feet long of 3 to 4 inches bore, weighing from fifteen to eighteen hundred
      pounds each; two (2) were &ldquo;minions&rdquo; (or &ldquo;falcons&rdquo;),&mdash;guns of 3 1/2
      inch bore, weighing twelve hundred pounds (1200 lbs.) each; and two (2)
      were &ldquo;bases,&rdquo;&mdash;small guns of 1 1/4 inch bore, weighing some three
      hundred pounds (300 lbs.) each. These were mounted on &ldquo;the Hill&rdquo; fort or
      platform. It is probable that besides these were the four smallest cannon,
      called &ldquo;patereros&rdquo; (or &ldquo;murderers&rdquo;), which, at the time of De Rasiere&rsquo;s
      visit to Plymouth in 1627, were mounted on a platform (in front of the
      Governor&rsquo;s house), at the intersection of the two streets of the town, and
      commanded its several approaches. It is not likely that they were sent for
      after 1621, because the Adventurers were never in mood to send if asked,
      while Bradford, in speaking of the first alarm by the Indians, says, &ldquo;This
      caused us to plant our great ordnance in places most convenient,&rdquo; leaving
      a possible inference that they had smaller ordnance in reserve. With this
      ordnance was of course a proper supply of ammunition adapted to its use.
      The &ldquo;sakers&rdquo; are said to have carried a four-pound ball, the &ldquo;minions&rdquo; a
      three-pound ball, and the &ldquo;bases&rdquo; a ball of a pound weight. There is not
      entire agreement between authorities, in regard to the size, weight, and
      calibre of these different classes of early ordnance, or the weight of
      metal thrown by them, but the above are approximate data, gathered from
      careful comparison of the figures given by several. There is no doubt that
      with this heavy ordnance and ammunition they stowed among their ballast
      and dunnage (as was the case in Higginson&rsquo;s ships), their &ldquo;spare chains
      and anchors, chalk, bricks, sea-coal (for blacksmithing), iron, steel,
      lead, copper, red-lead, salt,&rdquo; etc.; all of which they also necessarily
      had, and from their bulk, character, and weight, would stow as low in the
      ship as might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a considerable &ldquo;stock of trading goods&rdquo; was included in the
      MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S lading is mentioned by at least one writer, and that this was
      a fact is confirmed by the records of the colonists&rsquo; dealings with the
      Indians, and the enumeration of not a few of the goods which could have
      had, for the most part, no other use or value. They consisted largely of
      knives, bracelets (bead and metal), rings, scissors, copper-chains, beads,
      &ldquo;blue and red trading cloth,&rdquo; cheap (glass) jewels (&ldquo;for the ears,&rdquo; etc.),
      small mirrors, clothing (e. g. &ldquo;red-cotton horseman&rsquo;s coats&mdash;laced,&rdquo;
       jerkins, blankets, etc.), shoes, &ldquo;strong waters,&rdquo; pipes, tobacco, tools
      and hard ware (hatchets, nails, hoes, fish-hooks, etc.), rugs, twine,
      nets, etc., etc. A fragment of one of the heavy hoes of the ancient
      pattern&mdash;&ldquo;found on the site of the Pilgrim trading house at Manomet&rdquo;&mdash;is
      owned by the Pilgrim Society, and speaks volumes of the labor performed by
      the Pilgrims, before they had ploughs and draught-cattle, in the raising
      of their wonderful crops of corn. Such was the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S burden,
      animate and inanimate, whe &mdash;the last passenger and the last piece of
      freight transferred from the SPEEDWELL&mdash;her anchor &ldquo;hove short,&rdquo; she
      swung with the tide in Plymouth roadstead, ready to depart at last for
      &ldquo;the Virginia plantations.&rdquo;

                              don to see the ships dispatched,  but, on
                              the refusal of the Planters to sign certain
                              papers, took offence and returned to London
                              in displeasure, bidding them &ldquo;stand on
                              their own legs,&rdquo; etc.

     [The two &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; which Weston had changed in the proposed
     agreement between the Adventurers and Planters, the Leyden leaders
     refused to agree to.  Bradford, op  cit.  p. 61.  He says: &ldquo;But they
     refused to sign, and answered him that he knew right well that these
     were not according to the first Agreement.&rdquo;  Dr. Griffis has made
     one of those little slips common to all writers&mdash;though perfectly
     conversant with the facts&mdash;in stating as he does (The Pilgrims in
     their Three Homes, etc.  p.  158), with reference to the new
     &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; which some blamed Cushman for assenting to, as &ldquo;more
     fit for thieves and slaves than for honest men,&rdquo; that, &ldquo;nevertheless
     they consented to them;&rdquo; while on p. 169 he says &ldquo;The SPEEDWELL
     people [i.e.  the Leyden leaders would not agree with the new
     conditions, without the consent of those left behind in Leyden.&rdquo;

     The fact is that the Pilgrims did not assent to the new conditions,
     unwarrantably imposed by Weston, though of small consequence in any
     view of the case, until Cushman came over to New Plymouth in the
     FORTUNE, in 1621, and by dint of his sermon on the &ldquo;Sin and Danger
     of Self-Love,&rdquo; and his persuasion, induced them (they being also
     advised thereto by Robinson) to sign them.  All business up to this
     time had been done between the Adventurers and the Pilgrims,
     apparently, without any agreement in writing.  It was probably felt,
     both by Robinson and the Plymouth leaders, that it was the least
     reparation they could make Cushman for their cruel and unjust
     treatment of him, realizing at length that, through all
     vicissitudes, he had proven their just, sagacious, faithful, and
     efficient friend.  There does not appear to be any conclusive
     evidence that any articles of agreement between the Adventurers and
     colonists were signed before the MAY-FLOWER Sailed.]

     the ships to Dartmouth, and confuses dates, as he says &ldquo;But the next
     day after leaving Southampton the lesser ship sprung a leak that
     forced their return to Plymouth,&rdquo; etc.  Smith, New England&rsquo;s Trials,
     2d ed.  1622.  Cushman&rsquo;s letter, written the 17th, says they had

     the MAY-FLOWER, &ldquo;will not suffer them the passengers to go, ashore

     [Cushman portrays the contemptible character and manner of Martin
     very sharply, and could not have wished to punish him worse for his
     meannesses than he has, by thus holding him up to the scorn of the
     world, for all time.  He says, &lsquo;inter alia&rsquo;: &ldquo;If I speak to him, he

     [Goodwin notes (Pilgrim Republic, p. 57) that &ldquo;it was fortunate for

                              &ldquo;governour.&rdquo;

     [We have seen that Christopher Martin was made &ldquo;governour&rdquo; of the
     passengers on the MAY-FLOWER for the voyage, and Cushman
     &ldquo;assistant.&rdquo;  It is evident from Cushman&rsquo;s oft-quoted letter (see
     ante) that Martin became obnoxious, before the ship reached
     Dartmouth, to both passengers and crew.  It is also evident that
     when the emigrants were all gathered in the MAY-FLOWER there was a
     new choice of officers (though no record is found of it), as Cushman
     vacated his place and went back to London, and we find that, as
     noted before, on November 11 the colonists &ldquo;confirmed&rdquo; John Carver
     as their &ldquo;governour,&rdquo; showing that he had been such hitherto.
     Doubtless Martin was deposed at Southampton (perhaps put into
     Cushman&rsquo;s vacant place, and Carver made &ldquo;governour&rdquo; in his stead.)]

                              The first death and burial at sea of the
                              voyage.

     [We can readily imagine this first burial at sea on the MAY FLOWER,
     and its impressiveness.  Doubtless the good Elder &ldquo;committed the
     body to the deep&rdquo; with fitting ceremonial, for though the young man
     was of the crew, and not of the Pilgrim company, his reverence for
     death and the last rites of Christian burial would as surely impel
     him to offer such services, as the rough, buccaneering Master (Jones
     would surely be glad to evade them).

     Dr. Griffis (The Pilgrims in their Three Homes, p. 176) says &ldquo;The
     Puritans [does this mean Pilgrims ?] cared next to nothing about
     ceremonies over a corpse, whether at wave or grave.&rdquo;  This will
     hardly bear examination, though Bradford&rsquo;s phraseology in this case
     would seem to support it, as he speaks of the body as &ldquo;thrown
     overboard;&rdquo; yet it is not to be supposed that it was treated quite
     so indecorously as the words would imply.  It was but a few years
     after, certainly, that we find both Pilgrim and Puritan making much
     ceremony at burials.  We find considerable ceremony at Carver&rsquo;s
     burial only a few months later.  Choate, in his masterly oration at
     New York, December 22, 1863, pictures Brewster&rsquo;s service at the open
     grave of one of the Pilgrims in March, 1621.]

                              A sharp change.  Equinoctial weather,
                              followed by stormy westerly gales;
                              encountered cross winds and continued
                              fierce storms.  Ship shrewdly shaken and
                              her upper works made very leaky.  One of
                              the main beams in the midships was bowed
                              and cracked.  Some fear that the ship could
                              not be able to perform the voyage.  The
                              chief of the company perceiving the
                              mariners to fear the sufficiency of the
                              ship (as appeared by their mutterings) they
                              entered into serious consultation with the
                              Master and other officers of the ship, to
                              consider, in time, of the danger, and
                              rather to return than to cast themselves
                              into a desperate and inevitable peril.

                              There was great distraction and difference
                              of opinion amongst the mariners themselves.
                              Fain would they do what would be done for
                              their wages&rsquo; sake, being now near half the
                              seas over; on the other hand, they were
                              loath to hazard their lives too
                              desperately. In examining of all opinions,
                              the Master and others affirmed they knew
                              the ship to be strong and firm under water,
                              and for the buckling bending or bowing of
                              the main beam, there was a great iron scrue
                              the passengers brought out of Holland which
                              would raise the beam into its place.  The
                              which being done, the carpenter and Master
                              affirmed that a post put under it, set firm
                              in the lower deck, and otherwise bound,
                              would make it sufficient.  As for the decks
                              and upper works, they would caulk them as
                              well as they could; and though with the
                              working of the ship they would not long
                              keep staunch, yet there would otherwise be
                              no great danger if they did not overpress
                              her with sails.  So they resolved to
                              proceed.

                              In sundry of these stormes, the winds were
                              so fierce and the seas so high, as the ship
                              could not bear a knot of sail, but was
                              forced to hull drift under bare poles for
                              divers days together.  A succession of
                              strong westerly gales.  In one of the
                              heaviest storms, while lying at hull, [hove
                              to  D.W.] a lusty young man, one of the
                              passengers, John Howland by name, coming
                              upon some occasion above the gratings
                              latticed covers to the hatches, was with
                              the seel [roll] of the ship thrown into the
                              sea, but caught hold of the topsail
                              halliards, which hung overboard and ran out
                              at length; yet he held his hold, though he
                              was sundry fathoms under water, till he was
                              hauled up by the same rope to the brim of
                              the water, and then with a boathook and
                              other means got into the ship again and his
                              life saved.  He was something ill with it.

                              The equinoctial disturbances over and the
                              strong October gales, the milder, warmer
                              weather of late October followed.

                              Mistress Elizabeth Hopkins, wife of Master
                              Stephen Hopkins, of Billericay, in Essex,
                              was delivered of a son, who, on account of
                              the circumstances of his birth, was named
                              Oceanus, the first birth aboard the ship
                              during the voyage.

                              A succession of fine days, with favoring
                              winds.

                              made out to be Cape Cod the bluffs [in what
                              is now the town of Truro, Mass.].  After a
                              conference between the Master of the ship
                              and the chief colonists, tacked about and

     up again for the Cape.&rdquo;  No one will question that Jones&rsquo;s assertion
     of inability to proceed, and his announced determination to return
     to Cape Cod harbor, fell upon many acquiescent ears, for, as Winslow
     says: &ldquo;Winter was come; the seas were dangerous; the season was
     cold; the winds were high, and the region being well furnished for a
     plantation, we entered upon discovery.&rdquo;  Tossed for sixty-seven days
     on the north Atlantic at that season of the year, their food and
     firing well spent, cold, homesick, and ill, the bare thought of once
     again setting foot on any land, wherever it might be, must have been
     an allurement that lent Jones potential aid in his high-handed

SATURDAY Nov. 11/21
                              Comes in with light, fair wind.  On course
                              for Cape Cod harbor, along the coast.  Some
                              hints of disaffection among colonists, on
                              account of abandonment of location

     [Bradford (in Mourt&rsquo;s Relation) says: &ldquo;This day before we come to
     harbor Italics the author&rsquo;s, observing some not well affected to
     unity and concord, but gave some appearance of faction, it was
     thought good there should be an Association and Agreement that we
     should combine together in one body; and to submit to such
     Government and Governors as we should, by common consent, agree to
     make and choose, and set our hands to this that follows word for
     word.&rdquo;  Then follows the Compact. Bradford is even more explicit in
     his Historie (Mass. ed.  p. 109), where he says: &ldquo;I shall a little
     returne backe and begin with a combination made by them before they
     came ashore, being ye first foundation of their governments in this
     place; occasioned partly by ye discontent &amp; mutinous speeches that
     some of the strangers amongst them [i.e.  not any of the Leyden
     contingent had let fall from them in ye ship&mdash;That when they came
     ashore they would use their owne libertie: for none had power to
     command them, the patents they had being for Virginia, and not for
     New-England which belonged to another Government, with which ye
     London [or First Virginia Company had nothing to doe, and partly
     that such an acte by them done .  .  .  might be as firm as any
     patent, and in some respects more sure.&rdquo;  Dr. Griffis is hardly
     warranted in making Bradford to say, as he does (The Pilgrims in
     their Three Homes, p. 182), that &ldquo;there were a few people I
     &lsquo;shuffled&rsquo; in upon them the company who were probably unmitigated
     scoundrels.&rdquo;  Bradford speaks only of Billington and his family as
     those &ldquo;shuffled into their company,&rdquo; and while he was not improbably
     one of the agitators (with Hopkins) who were the proximate causes of
     the drawing up of the Compact, he was not, in this case, the
     responsible leader. It is evident from the foregoing that the
     &ldquo;appearance of faction&rdquo; did not show itself until the vessel&rsquo;s prow
     was turned back toward Cape Cod Harbor, and it became apparent that
     the effort to locate &ldquo;near Hudson&rsquo;s River&rdquo; was to be abandoned, and
     a location found north of 41 degrees north latitude, which would
     leave them without charter rights or authority of any kind.  It is
     undoubtedly history that Master Stephen Hopkins,&mdash;then &ldquo;a
     lay-reader&rdquo; for Chaplain Buck,&mdash;on Sir Thomas Gates&rsquo;s expedition to
     Virginia, had, when some of them were cast away on the Bermudas,
     advocated just such sentiments&mdash;on the same basis&mdash;as were now
     bruited upon the MAY-FLOWER, and it could hardly have been
     coincidence only that the same were repeated here.  That Hopkins
     fomented the discord is well-nigh certain.  It caused him, as
     elsewhere noted, to receive sentence of death for insubordination,
     at the hands of Sir Thomas Gates, in the first instance, from which
     his pardon was with much difficulty procured by his friends.  In the
     present case, it led to the drafting and execution of the Pilgrim
     Compact, a framework of civil self-government whose fame will never
     die; though the author is in full accord with Dr. Young (Chronicles,
     p. 120) in thinking that &ldquo;a great deal more has been discovered in
     this document than the signers contemplated,&rdquo;&mdash;wonderfully
     comprehensive as it is.  Professor Herbert B. Adams, of Johns
     Hopkins University, says in his admirable article in the Magazine of
     American History, November, 1882 (pp&mdash;798 799): &ldquo;The fundamental
     idea of this famous document was that of a contract based upon the
     common law of England,&rdquo;&mdash;certainly a stable and ancient basis of
     procedure.  Their Dutch training (as Griffis points out) had also
     led naturally to such ideas of government as the Pilgrims adopted.
     It is to be feared that Griffis&rsquo;s inference (The Pilgrims in their
     Three Homes, p. 184), that all who signed the Compact could write,
     is unwarranted.  It is more than probable that if the venerated
     paper should ever be found, it would show that several of those
     whose names are believed to have been affixed to it &ldquo;made their
     &lsquo;mark.&rsquo;&rdquo;  There is good reason, also, to believe that neither
     &ldquo;sickness&rdquo; (except unto death) nor &ldquo;indifference&rdquo; would have
     prevented the ultimate obtaining of the signatures (by &ldquo;mark,&rdquo; if
     need be) of every one of the nine male servants who did not
     subscribe, if they were considered eligible.  Severe illness was, we
     know, answerable for the absence of a few, some of whom died a few
     days later.

     The fact seems rather to be, as noted, that age&mdash;not social status
     was the determining factor as to all otherwise eligible.  It is
     evident too, that the fact was recognized by all parties (by none so
     clearly as by Master Jones) that they were about to plant themselves
     on territory not within the jurisdiction of their steadfast friends,
     the London Virginia Company, but under control of those formerly of
     the Second (Plymouth) Virginia Company, who (by the intelligence
     they received while at Southampton) they knew would be erected into
     the &ldquo;Council for the Affairs of New England.&rdquo;  Goodwin is in error
     in saying (Pilgrim Republic, p. 62), &ldquo;Neither did any other body
     exercise authority there;&rdquo; for the Second Virginia Company under Sir
     Ferdinando Gorges, as noted, had been since 1606 in control of this
     region, and only a week before the Pilgrims landed at Cape Cod (i.e.
     on November 3) King James had signed the patent of the Council for
     New England, giving them full authority over all territory north of
     the forty-first parallel of north latitude, as successors to the
     Second Virginia Company. If the intention to land south of the
     forty-first parallel had been persisted in, there would, of course,
     have been no occasion for the Compact, as the patent to John Pierce
     (in their interest) from the London Virginia Company would have been
     in force.  The Compact became a necessity, therefore, only when they
     turned northward to make settlement above 41 deg. north latitude.
     Hence it is plain that as no opportunity for &ldquo;faction&rdquo;&mdash;and so no
     occasion for any &ldquo;Association and Agreement&rdquo;&mdash;existed till the
     MAY-FLOWER turned northward, late in the afternoon of Friday,
     November to, the Compact was not drawn and presented for signature
     until the morning of Saturday, November 11.  Bradford&rsquo;s language,
     &ldquo;This day, before we came into harbour,&rdquo; leaves no room for doubt
     that it was rather hurriedly drafted&mdash;and also signed&mdash;before noon
     of the 11th. That they had time on this winter Saturday&mdash;hardly
     three weeks from the shortest day in the year&mdash;to reach and
     encircle the harbor; secure anchorage; get out boats; arm, equip,
     and land two companies of men; make a considerable march into the
     land; cut firewood; and get all aboard again before dark, indicates
     that they must have made the harbor not far from noon.  These facts
     serve also to correct another error of traditional Pilgrim history,
     which has been commonly current, and into which Davis falls
     (Ancient Landmarks of Plymouth, p. 60), viz.  that the Compact was
     signed &ldquo;in the harbor of Cape Cod.&rdquo;  It is noticeable that the
     instrument itself simply says, &ldquo;Cape Cod,&rdquo; not &ldquo;Cape Cod harbour,&rdquo;
      as later they were wont to say.  The leaders clearly did not mean
     to get to port till there was a form of law and authority.]

                              for settlement on territory under the
                              protection of the patent granted in their
                              interest to John Pierce, by the London
                              Virginia Company.

     [The patent granted John Pierce, one of the Merchant Adventurers,
     by the London Virginia Company in the interest of the Pilgrims,
     was signed February 2/12, 1619, and of course could convey no rights
     to, or upon, territory not conveyed to the Company by its charter
     from the King issued in 1606, and the division of territory made
     thereunder to the Second Virginia Company.  By this division the
     London Company was restricted northward by the 41st parallel, as
     noted, while the Second Company could not claim the 38th as its
     southern bound, as the charter stipulated that the nearest
     settlements under the respective companies should not be within one
     hundred miles of each other.]

                              Meeting in main cabin of all adult male
                              passengers except their two hired seamen,
                              Trevore and Ely, and those too ill&mdash;to make
                              and sign a mutual &lsquo;Compact&rdquo;

     [The Compact is too well known to require reprinting here (see
     Appendix); but a single clause of it calls for comment in this
     connection.  In it the framers recite that, &ldquo;Having undertaken to
     plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia,&rdquo; etc.
     From this phraseology it would appear that they here used the words
     &ldquo;northern parts of Virginia&rdquo; understandingly, and with a new
     relation and significance, from their connection with the words &ldquo;the
     first colony in,&rdquo; for such declaration could have no force or truth
     except as to the region north of 41 deg. north latitude.  They knew,
     of course, of the colonies in Virginia under Gates, Wingfield,
     Smith, Raleigh, and others (Hopkins having been with Gates), and
     that, though there had been brief attempts at settlements in the
     &ldquo;northern plantations,&rdquo; there were none there then, and that hence
     theirs would be in a sense &ldquo;the first,&rdquo; especially if considered
     with reference to the new Council for New England.  The region of
     the Hudson had heretofore been included in the term &ldquo;northern parts
     of Virginia,&rdquo; although in the southern Company&rsquo;s limit; but a new

     says: &ldquo;Monday, the 13th of November, we unshipped our shallop and
     drew her on land to mend and repair her, having been forced to cut
     her down, in bestowing her betwixt the decks, and she was much
     opened, with the peoples lying in her, which kept us long there: for
     it was sixteen or seventeen days before the Carpenter had finished
     her.&rdquo;  Goodwin says she was &ldquo;a sloop-rigged craft of twelve or
     fifteen tons.&rdquo;  There is an intimation of Bradford that she was
     &ldquo;about thirty feet long.&rdquo;  It is evident from Bradford&rsquo;s account
     (Historie, Mass. ed. p. 105) of her stormy entrance to Plymouth

                              discussion of plans for settlement.  The
                              Master urging that the Planters should
                              explore with their shallop at some
                              distance, declining in such season to stir
                              from the present anchorage till a safe
                              harbor is discovered by them where they
                              would be and he might go without danger.
                              This day died Edward Thompson, a servant of
                              Master William White, the first to die
                              aboard the ship since she anchored in the
                              harbor.  Burying-party sent ashore after
                              services to bury him.

TUESDAY, Dec. 19/29
                              At anchor, Plymouth harbor.  A party from
                              the ship went ashore to discover, some
                              going by land and some keeping to the
                              shallop.  A creek was found leading up
                              within the land and followed up three
                              English miles, a very pleasant river at
                              full sea.  It was given the name of &ldquo;Jones

WEDNESDAY, Dec. 20/30
                              At anchor, Plymouth harbor, many ill. Dec.
                              After service the colonists decided to go
                              ashore this morning and determine upon one
                              of two places which were thought most
                              fitting for their habitation.  So a
                              considerable party went ashore and left
                              twenty of their number there to make a
                              rendezvous, the rest coming on board at
                              night.  They reported that they had chosen
                              by the most voices the site first looked at
                              by the largest brook, near where they
                              landed on the 11th on a large rock
                              [Plymouth Rock].

     [The &ldquo;Rock&rdquo; seems to have become the established landing place of
     the Pilgrims, from the time of the first visit of the third
     exploring party on December 11/21.  The absurdity of the claims of
     the partisans of Mary Chilton, in the foolish contention which
     existed for many years as to whether she or John Alden was the first
     person to set foot upon the &ldquo;Rock,&rdquo; is shown by the fact that, of
     course, no women were with the third exploring party which first
     landed there, while it is also certain that Alden was not of that
     exploring party.  That Mary Chilton may have been the first woman to
     land at Cape Cod harbor is entirely possible, as it is that she or
     John Alden may have been the first person to land on the &ldquo;Rock&rdquo;
      after the ship arrived in Plymouth harbor.  It was a vexatious
     travesty upon history (though perpetuated by parties who ought to
     have been correct) that the Association for building the Pilgrim
     Monument at Plymouth should issue a pamphlet giving a picture of the
     &ldquo;Landing of the Pilgrims, December 21, 1620,&rdquo; in which women are
     pictured, and in which the shallop is shown with a large
     fore-and-aft mainsail, while on the same page is another picture
     entitled, &ldquo;The Shallop of the MAY-FLOWER,&rdquo; having a large yard and
     square-sail, and a &ldquo;Cuddy&rdquo; (which last the MAY-FLOWER&rsquo;S shallop we
     know did not have).  The printed description of the picture,
     however, says: &ldquo;The cut is copied from a picture by Van der Veldt,
     a Dutch painter of the seventeenth century, representing a
     shallop,&rdquo; etc.  It is matter of regret to find that a book like
     Colonel T. W. Higginson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Book of American Explorers&rsquo;, intended
     for a text-book, and bearing the imprint of a house like Longmans,
     Green &amp; Co. should actually print a &ldquo;cut&rdquo; showing Mary Chilton
     landing from a boat full of men (in which she is the only woman)
     upon a rock, presumably Plymouth Rock.]

                              extremely all night.  Very uncomfortable
                              for the party on shore.  So tempestuous
                              that the shallop could not go to land as
                              soon as was meet, for they had no victuals
                              on land.  About eleven o&rsquo;clock the shallop
                              went off with much ado with provision, but
                              could not return, it blew so strong.  Such
                              foul weather forced to ride with three
                              anchors ahead.  This day Richard
                              Britteridge, one of the colonists, died
                              aboard the ship, the first to die in this
                              harbor.

FRIDAY, Dec. 22/Jan. 1

                              continues, so that no one could go ashore,
                              or those on land come aboard.  This morning
                              goodwife Allerton was delivered of a son,

                              thought, that day.  A large party went

                              begin building.  They began to erect the

     [Mourt&rsquo;s Relation, Dexter&rsquo;s ed. p. 77.  Bradford states (op. cit.

     by &ldquo;want of boats,&rdquo; as well as sickness.  Mention is made only of
     the &ldquo;long-boat&rdquo; and shallop.  It is possible there were no others,

     [Bradford, Historie, p. 92; Young, Chronicler, p. 198.  Bradford
     says (op. cit.  Mass. ed, pp. 120, 121): &ldquo;The reason on their parts
     why she stayed so long was ye necessitie and danger that lay upon
     them, for it was well toward ye ende of December before she could
     land anything here, or they able to receive anything ashore.  After
     wards, ye 14 of January the house which they had made for a general
     randevoze by casulty fell afire, and some were faine to retire
     aboard for shelter.  Then the sickness begane to fall sore amongst
     them, and ye weather so bad as they could not make much sooner
     dispatch.  Againe, the Governor &amp; chiefe of them seeing so many dye,
     and fall down sick dayly, thought it no wisdom to send away the
     ship, their condition considered, and the danger they stood in from
     ye Indians, till they could procure some shelter; and therefore
     thought it better to draw some more charge upon themselves &amp; friends
     [&ldquo;demurrage?&rdquo;] than hazard all.  The Mr. and sea-men likewise;
     though before they hasted ye passengers a shore to be goone [gone],
     now many of their men being dead, and of ye ablest of them [as is
     before noted, and of ye rest many lay sick &amp; weake, ye Mr, durst not
     put to sea till he saw his men begine to recover, and ye hart of
     winter over.&rdquo;]]

                              A very rainy day with the heaviest gusts of
                              wind yet experienced.  The ship in some

                              was Master White.  Their deaths much

                              Allerton, wife of Master Isaac Allerton,

TUESDAY, Feb. 27/Mar. 9
                              At anchorage.  The sickness and deaths of
                              the colonists on shore have steadily
                              increased, and have extended to the ship,
                              which has lost several of its petty
                              officers, including the master gunner,
                              three quarter-masters, and cook, and a
                              third of the crew, many from scurvy.

     [There can be no doubt that both planters and ship&rsquo;s crew suffered
     severely from scurvy.  The conditions all favored it, the sailors
     were familiar with it, and would not be likely to be mistaken in
     their recognition of it, and Dr. Fuller, their competent physician,
     would not be likely to err in his diagnosis of it.  Tuberculosis was
     its very natural associate.]

FRIDAY, Mar. 16/26
                              At anchorage.  A fair, warm day, towards
                              noon.  The Master and others went ashore to
                              the general meeting.  The plantation was
                              startled this morning by a visit from an
                              Indian who spoke some English and bade
                              &ldquo;Welcome.&rdquo;  He is from Monhiggon, an island
                              to the eastward some days&rsquo; sail, near where
                              Sir Ferdinando Gorges had a settlement.  He
                              was friendly, and having had much
                              intercourse with Englishmen who came to
                              fish in those parts, very comfortable with
                              them.  He saw the ship in the harbor from a
                              distance and supposed her to be a fishing
                              vessel.  He told the Governor that the
                              plantation was formerly called &ldquo;Patuxet&rdquo;
                               [or Apaum], and that all its inhabitants
                              had been carried off by a plague about four
                              years ago.  All the afternoon was spent in
                              communication with him.  The Governor
                              purposed sending him aboard the ship at
                              night, and he was well content to go and
                              went aboard the shallop to come to the
                              ship, but the wind was high and water scant
                              [low], so that the shallop could not go to
                              the ship.  The Governor sent him to Master
                              Hopkins&rsquo;s house and set a watch over him.

SUNDAY, Mar. 18/28
                              At anchor in Plymouth harbor.  The

                              anchorage.  A fair day.  The sickness
                              stayed a little.  Many went on shore to the
                              meeting in the common-house.  Samoset the
                              savage came again, and brought five others
                              with him.

     [This Sunday visit was doubtless very much to the dislike of the
     good brethren, or at least of the leaders, but policy dictated every
     possible forbearance.  Their consciences drew the line at trade,
     however, and they got rid of their untimely visitors as soon as
     possible without giving offense.  Massasoit&rsquo;s men seem to have
     shown, by leaving their peltry with them, a confidence in their new
     white neighbors that is remarkable in view of the brevity of their
     friendship.]

                              They left their bows and arrows a quarter
                              of a mile from the town, as instructed.
                              The Planters gave them entertainment, but
                              would not truck with them.

     [&ldquo;Truck&mdash;to trade.&rdquo;  All early and modern lexicographers give the
     word, which, though now obsolete, was in common use in parts of New
     England fifty years ago.]

                              They sang and danced after their manner,
                              and made semblance of amity and friendship.
                              They drank tobacco and carried pounded corn
                              to eat.  Their faces were painted.  They
                              brought a few skins which they left with
                              the Planters, and returned the tools which
                              Captain Standish and Francis Cooke left in
                              the woods.  The Planters dismissed them
                              with a few trifles as soon as they could,
                              it being Sunday, and they promised soon to
                              return and trade.  Samoset would not go
                              with them, feigning sick, and stayed.
                              Those on shore from the ship came off to

                              Indian Samoset away.  A general meeting of
                              the Planters was held at the common-house,
                              to conclude laws and orders, and to confirm
                              the military orders formerly proposed, and
                              twice broken off by the savages coming, as
                              happened again.  After the meeting had held
                              an hour or so, two or three savages
                              appeared on the hill over against the town,
                              and made semblance of daring the Planters.
                              Captain Standish and another, with their
                              muskets, went over to them, with the two
                              Masters-mates of the ship, who were ashore,
                              also armed with muskets.  The savages made
                              show of defiance, but as our men drew near
                              they ran away.  This day the carpenter, who
                              has long been ill of scurvy, fitted the
                              shallop to carry all the goods and
                              furniture aboard the ship, on shore.

                              able attended.  They had scarce been an

                              again with one Squanto, the only native of
                              Patuxet (where the Planters now inhabit)
                              surviving, who was one of the twenty captives

                              to England.  He could speak a little English.
                              They brought three other Indians with them.
                              They signified that their great Sagamore,
                              Masasoyt, was hard by, with Quadequina his
                              brother, and all their men.  They could not
                              well express what they would in English,
                              but after an hour the king came to the top
                              of the hill, over against the plantation,
                              with his train of about sixty men.  Squanto
                              went to him and brought a message that one
                              should be sent to parley with him, and Master
                              Edward Winslow went, to know hisnmind, and
                              signify the wish of the Governor to have
                              trading and peace with him, the Governor
                              sending presents to the king and his brother,
                              with something to eat and drink.

     [Edward Winslow gives us here another proof of that rare
     self-sacrifice, that entire devotion to his work, and that splendid
     intrepidity which so signally characterized his whole career.  At
     this most critical moment, the fate of the little colony trembling
     in the balance, when there was evident fear of treachery and
     surprise on the part of both the English and the savages; though the
     wife of his youth lay at the point of death (which came but two days
     later), and his heart was heavy with grief; forgetting all but the
     welfare of his little band of brethren, he goes forward alone, his
     life in his hand, to meet the great sachem surrounded by his whole
     tribe, as the calm, adroit diplomatist, upon whom all must depend;
     and as the fearless hostage, to put himself in pawn for the savage
     chief.]

                              The king, leaving Master Winslow with
                              brother, came over the brook, with some
                              twenty of his men, leaving their bows and
                              arrows behind them, and giving some six or
                              seven of their men as hostages for Master
                              Winslow.  Captain Standish, with Master
                              Williamson, the ship&rsquo;s-merchant, as
                              interpreter,

     [It would seem from the frequent mention of the presence of some of
     the ship&rsquo;s company, Master Jones, the &ldquo;Masters-mates,&rdquo; and now the
     &ldquo;ship&rsquo;s-merchant,&rdquo; that the ship was daily well represented in the
     little settlement on shore.  The presence of Master Williamson on
     this occasion is perhaps readily accounted for.  Every other meeting
     with the Indians had been unexpected, the present one was
     anticipated, and somewhat eagerly, for upon its successful issue
     almost everything depended.  By this time Standish had probably
     become aware that Tisquantum&rsquo;s command of English was very limited,
     and he desired all the aid the ship&rsquo;s interpreter could give.  By
     some means, the sachem and the colonists succeeded in establishing
     on this day a very good and lasting understanding.]

                              and a guard of half a dozen musketeers, met
                              the king at the brook,

     [The guard was probably made thus small to leave the body of the
     colonists as strong a reserve force as possible to meet any surprise
     attack on the part of the Indians.  Colonel Higginson, in his Book
     of American Explorers, gives a cut of this meeting of Massasoit and
     his pineses with Standish and his guard of honor, but it is
     defective in that the guard seems to have advanced to the hill
     (&ldquo;Strawberry,&rdquo; or later &ldquo;Watson&rsquo;s&rdquo;) to meet the sachem, instead of
     only to &ldquo;the brook;&rdquo; and more especially in that there are but two
     officers with the &ldquo;six musketeers,&rdquo; where there ought to be three,
     viz.  Standish, in command, Edward Window, as the envoy and hostage
     (in full armor), and &ldquo;Mr. Williamson,&rdquo; the ship&rsquo;s-merchant or
     purser, as interpreter, perhaps acting as lieutenant of the guard.
     It is always matter of regret when books, especially text-books,
     written by authors of some repute, and published by reputable
     houses, fail, for want of only a little care in the study of the
     available history of events they pictorially represent, to make
     their pictures and the known facts correspond.]

                              and they saluted each other, and the guard
                              conducted the Sagamore to one of the new
                              houses then building, where were placed a
                              green rug and three or four cushions.  Then
                              came the Governor with drum and trumpet,
                              and a guard of musketeers, and they drank
                              to each other in some strong waters, and
                              the Governor gave the king and his
                              followers meat, and they made a treaty in
                              King James&rsquo;s name, and drank tobacco
                              together. His face was painted a sad red,
                              and his head and face were oiled, which
                              made him look greasy.  All his followers
                              were more or less painted.  So after all
                              was done, the Governor conducted him to the
                              brook, and his brother came, and was also
                              feasted, and then conveyed him to the
                              brook, and Master Winslow returned.
                              Samoset and Squanto stayed in the town and
                              the Indians stayed all night in the woods
                              half a mile away.  The last of the
                              colonists on board the ship went ashore to
                              remain to-day.

FRIDAY, Mar. 23/Apr. 2
                              At anchor.  A fair day.  Some of the ship&rsquo;s
                              company went on shore.  Some of the Indians
                              came again, and Captain Standish and Master
                              Allerton went to see the king, and were
                              welcomed by him.  This morning the Indians
                              stayed till ten or eleven of the clock, and
                              the Governor, sending for the king&rsquo;s
                              kettle, filled it with pease, and they went
                              their way?  Making ready for sea, getting
                              ballast, wood, and water from the shore,
                              etc.  The Planters held a meeting and
                              concluded both of military orders and some
                              laws, and chose as Governor, for the coming
                              year, Master John Carver, who was
                              &ldquo;governor&rdquo; on the ship.

    <p>
      7. He that shall carie his wife &amp; children, or servants, shall be
      alowed for everie person now aged 16. years &amp; upward, a single share
      in ye devision, or if he provid them necessaries, a duble share, or if
      they be between 10. year old and 16., then 2. of them to be reconed for a

    </p>
    <p>
      8. That such children as now goe, &amp; are under ye age of ten years,

    <p>
      Governor Bradford adds:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chief and principal differences betwene these &amp; the former
      [original] conditions, stood in those 2. points; that ye houses, &amp;
      lands improved, espetialy gardens &amp; home lotts should remaine
      undevided wholy to ye planters at ye 7. years end. 2ly, yt they should
      have had 2. days in a weeke for their owne private imploymente, for ye
      more comforte of themselves and their families, espetialy such as had
      families.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      [Apparently, as has been noted, neither these articles of agreement, nor
      their predecessors which received the approval of the Leyden leaders, were
      ever signed by the contracting parties, until Robert Cushman brought the
      later draft over in the FORTUNE, in 1621, and the planter body (advised
      thereto by Pastor Robinson, who had previously bitterly opposed) signed
      them. Much might be truly said on either side of this controversy&mdash;indeed
      was said at the time; but if the Pilgrims were to abandon their
      contention, whatever its merits, in a year&rsquo;s time, as they did, it would
      seemingly have been much better not to have begun it, for it undoubtedly
      cost them dear.]

    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
May 31/June 10, 1620.

    To their loving freinds John Carver and Robart Cushman, these, &amp;c.

Good bretheren, after salutations, &amp;c.  We received diverse letters at ye
coming of Mr. [Thomas] Nash &amp; our pilott, which is a great incouragmente
unto us, and for whom we hop after times will minister occasion of
praising God; and indeed had you not sente him, many would have been
ready to fainte and goe backe.  Partly in respecte of ye new conditions
which have bene taken up by you, which all men are against, and partly in
regard of our owne inabillitie to doe any one of those many waightie
bussineses you referr to us here.  For ye former wherof, wheras Robart
Cushman desirs reasons for our dislike, promising therupon to alter ye
same, or els saing we should thinke he hath no brains, we desire him to
exercise them therin, refering him to our pastors former reasons, and
them to ye censure of ye godly wise.  But our desires are that you will
not entangle your selvs and us in any such unreasonable courses as those
are, viz. yt the marchants should have ye halfe of mens houses and lands
at ye dividente; and that persons should be deprived of ye 2. days in a
weeke agreed upon, yea every momente of time for their owne perticuler;
by reason wherof we cannot conceive why any should carie servants for
their own help and comfort; for that we can require no more of them than
all men one of another.  This we have only by relation from Mr. Nash, &amp;
not from any writing of your owne, &amp; therfore hope you have not proceeded
farr in so great a thing without us.  But requiring you not to exseed the
bounds of your comission, which was to proceed upon ye things or
conditions agred upon and expressed in writing (at your going over it),
we leave it, not without marveling, that your selfe, as you write,
knowing how smale a thing troubleth our consultations, and how few,
as you fear, understands the busnes aright, should trouble us with such
matters as these are, &amp;c. Salute Mr. Weston from us, in whom we hope we
are not deceived; we pray you make known our estate unto him, and if you
thinke good shew him our letters, at least tell him (yt under God) we
much relie upon him &amp; put our confidence in him; and, as your selves well
know, that if he had not been an adventurer with us, we had not taken it
in hand; presuming that if he had not seene means to accomplish it, he
would not have begune it; so we hope in our extremitie he will so farr
help us as our expectation be no way made frustrate concerning him.
Since therfor, good brethren, we have plainly opened ye state of things
with us in this matter, you will, &amp;c.  Thus beseeching ye Allmightie, who
is allsufficiente to raise us out of this depth of difficulties, to
assiste us herin; raising such means by his providence and fatherly care
for us, his pore children &amp; servants, as we may with comforte behould ye
hand of our God for good towards us in this our bussines, which we
undertake in his name &amp; fear, we take leave &amp; remaine
                              Your perplexed, yet hopful

      III<br /> THE LETTER OF ROBERT CUSHMAN (AT LONDON), TO JOHN CARVER (AT
      SOUTHAMPTON)
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
	  Saturday, June 10/20, 1620.

    To his loving freind Mr. John Carver, these, &amp;c.

    Loving freind, I have received from you some letters, full of affection &amp;
    complaints, &amp; what it is you would have of me I know not; for your
    crieing out, Negligence, negligence, negligence, I marvell why so
    negligente a man was used in ye bussines: Yet know you yt all that I have
    power to doe hear, shall not be one hower behind, I warent you.  You have
    reference to Mr. Weston to help us with money, more then his adventure;
    wher he protesteth but for his promise, he would not have done any thing.
    He saith we take a heady course, and is offended yt our provissions are
    made so farr of; as also that he was not made aquainted with our
    quantitie of things; and saith yt in now being in 3. places, so farr
    remote, (i.e.  Leyden, London, and Southampton) we will, with going up &amp;
    downe, and wrangling &amp; expostulating, pass over ye sourer before we will
    goe.  And to speake ye trueth, they is fallen already amongst us a flatt
    schisme; and we are redier to goe to dispute, then to sett forwarde a
    vaiage.  I have received from Leyden since you wente (to Southampton) 3.
    or 4. letters directed to you, though they only conscerne me.  I will not
    trouble you with them.  I always feared ye event of ye Amsterdamers
    (members of Rev. Henry Ainsworth&rsquo;s church there) striking in with us.
    I trow you must excomunicate me, or els you must goe without their
    companie, or we shall wante no quareling; but let them pass.

We have reckoned, it should seeme, without our host; and, count upon a
150. persons, ther cannot be founde above 1200li. &amp; odd moneys of all ye
venturs you can reckone, besids some cloath, stockings, &amp; shoes, which
are not counted; so we shall come shorte at least 3. or 400li.  I would
have had some thing shortened at first of beare (beer) &amp; other
provissions in hope of other adventurs, &amp; now we could have, both in
Amsterd &amp; Kente, beere inough to serve our turne, but now we cannot
accept it without prejudice.  You fear we have begune to build &amp; and
shall not be able to make an end; indeed, our courses were never
established by counsell, we may therfore justly fear their standing.
Yea, then was a schisme amongst us 3. at ye first.  You wrote to Mr.
Martin, to prevente ye making of ye provissions in Kente, which he did,
and sett downe his resolution how much he would have of every thing,
without respecte to any counsell or exception.  Surely he yt is in a
societie &amp; yet regards not counsell, may better be a king then a
consorte.  To be short, if then be not some other dispossition setled
unto then yet is, we yt should be partners of humilitie and peace, shall
be examples of jangling &amp; insulting.  Yet your money which you ther
[Southampton] must have, we will get provided for you instantly.  500li.
you say will serve; for ye rest which hear &amp; in Holand is to be used, we
may goe scratch for it.  For Mr. Crabe,  of whom you write, he hath
promised to goe with us, yet I tell you I shall not be without feare till
I see him shipped, for he [i.e.  his going] is much opposed, yet I hope
he will not faile. Thinke ye best of all, and bear with patience what is
wanting, and ye Lord guid us all.
                         Your loving freind,

    <h3>
      IV THE LETTER OF ROBERT CUSHMAN TO THE LEYDEN LEADERS
    </h3>
    <p>
      (Probably written at London, Saturday, June 10/20, 1620.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Brethern, I understand by letters &amp; passagess yt have come to me, that
      ther are great discontents, &amp; dislike of my proceedings amongst you.
      Sorie I am to hear it, yet contente to beare it, as not doubting but yt
      partly by writing, and more principally by word when we shall come
      togeather, I shall satisfie any reasonable man. I have been perswaded by
      some, espetialy this bearer, to come and clear things unto you; but as
      things now stand I cannot be absente one day, excepte I should hazard all
      ye viage. Neither conceive I any great good would come of it. Take then,
      brethern, this as a step to give you contente. First, for your dislike of
      ye alteration of one clause in ye conditions, if you conceive it right,
      ther can be no blame lye on me at all. For ye articles first brought over
      by John Carver were never seene of any of ye adventurers hear, excepte Mr.
      Weston, neither did any of them like them because of that clause; nor Mr.
      Weston him selfe, after he had well considered it. But as at ye first ther
      was 500li. withdrawne by Sr. Georg Farrer and his brother upon that
      dislike, so all ye rest would have withdrawne (Mr. Weston excepted) if we
      had not altered yt clause. Now whilst we at Leyden conclude upon points,
      as we did, we reckoned without our host, which was not my faulte. Besids,
      I shewed you by a letter ye equitie of yt condition, &amp; our
      inconveniences, which might be sett against all Mr. Rob: [Robinson&rsquo;s]
      inconveniences, that without ye alteration of yt clause, we could neither
      have means to gett thither, nor supplie wherby to subsiste when we were
      ther. Yet notwithstanding all those reasons, which were not mine, but
      other mens wiser than my selfe, without answer to any one of them, here
      cometh over many quirimonies, and complaints against me, of lording it
      over my brethern, and making conditions fitter for theeves &amp;
      bondslaves then honest men, and that of my owne head I did what I list.
      And at last a paper of reasons, framed against yt clause in ye conditions,
      which as yey were delivered me open, so my answer is open to you all. And
      first, as they are no other but inconveniences, such as a man might frame
      20. as great on ye other side, and yet prove nor disprove nothing by them,
      so they misse &amp; mistake both ye very ground of ye article and nature
      of ye project.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, first, it is said, that if ther had been no divission of houses &amp;
      lands, it had been better for ye poore. True, and yt showeth ye
      inequalitie of ye condition; we should more respect him yt ventureth both
      his money and his person, then him yt ventureth but his person only.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Consider whereaboute we are, not giveing almes, but furnishing a store
      house; no one shall be porer then another for 7. years, and if any be
      rich, none can be pore. At ye least, we must not in such bussines crie,
      Pore, pore, mercie, mercie. Charitie hath it[s] life in wraks, not in
      venturs; you are by this most in a hopefull pitie of makeing, therefore
      complaine not before you have need.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. This will hinder ye building of good and faire houses, contrarie to ye
      advise of pollitiks. A. So we would have it; our purpose is to build for
      ye presente such houses as, if need be, we may with litle greefe set a
      fire, and rune away by the lighte; our riches shall not be in pompe, but
      in strength; if God send us riches, we will imploye them to provid more
      men, ships, munition, &amp;c. You may see it amongst the best pollitiks,
      that a comonwele is readier to ebe then to flow, when once fine houses and
      gay cloaths come up.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The Govet may prevente excess in building. A. But if it be on all men
      beforehand resolved on, to build mean houses, ye Govet laboure is spared.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. All men are not of one condition. A. If by condition you mean wealth,
      you are mistaken; if you mean by condition, qualities, then I say he that
      is not contente his neighbour shall have as good a house, fare, means,
      &amp;c. as him selfe, is not of a good qualitie. 2ly. Such retired
      persons, as have an eie only to them selves, are fitter to come wher
      catching is, then closing; and are fitter to live alone, then in any
      societie, either civil or religious.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. It will be of litle value, scarce worth 5li. A. True, it may not be
      worth halfe 5li. If then so smale a thing will content them, (the
      Adventurers) why strive we thus aboute it, and give them occasion to
      suspecte us to be worldly &amp; covetous? I will not say what I have heard
      since these complaints came first over [from Leyden].
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Our freinds with us yt adventure mind not their owne profite, as did ye
      old adventurers. A. Then they are better than we, who for a little matter
      of profite are readie to draw back, and it is more apparente, brethern
      looke too it, that make profit your maine end; repente of this, els goe
      not least you be like Jonas to Tarshis. Though some of them mind not their
      profite, yet others doe mind it; and why not as well as we? venturs are
      made by all sorts of men, and we must labour to give them all contente, if
      we can.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. It will break ye course of comunitie, as may be showed by many reasons.
      A. That is but said, and I say againe, it will best foster comunion, as
      may be showed by many reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Great profite is like to be made by trucking, fishing, &amp;c. A. As it
      is better for them, so for us; for halfe is ours, besids our living still
      upon it, and if such profite in yt way come, our labour shall be ye less
      on ye land, and our houses &amp; lands will be of less value.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Our hazard is greater than theirs. A. True, but doe they put us upon
      it? doe they urge or egg us? hath not ye motion &amp; resolution been
      always in our selves? doe they any more then in seeing us resolute if we
      had means, help us to means upon equall termes &amp; conditions! If we
      will not goe, they are content to keep their moneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus I have pointed at a way to loose those knots, which I hope you will
      consider seriously, and let me have no more stirr about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now furder, I hear a noise of slavish conditions by me made; but surly
      this is all I have altered, and reasons I have sent you. If you mean it of
      ye 2. days in a week for perticuler, as some insinuate, you are deceived;
      you may have 3. days in a week for me if you will. And when I have spoken
      to ye adventurers of times of working, they have said they hope we are men
      of discretion &amp; conscience, and so fitt to be trusted our selves with
      that. But indeed ye ground of our proceedings at Leyden was mistaken, and
      so here is nothing but tottering every day, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for them of Amsterdam, [i.e. the members of Rev. Henry Ainsworth&rsquo;s
      church there] I had thought they would as soon gone to Rome as with us;
      for our libertie is to them as ratts bane, and their riggour as bad to us
      as ye Spanish Inquisition. If any practise of mine discourage them, let
      them yet draw back; I will undertake they shall have their money againe
      presently paid hear. Or if the Company think me to be ye Jonas, let them
      cast me of before we goe; I shall be content to stay with good will,
      having but ye cloaths on my back; only let us have quietnes, and no more
      of these clamors; full little did I expect these things which are now come
      to pass, &amp;c.<br /><br /> Yours,<br /> R. CUSHMAN.<br />

      V<br /> THE LETTER OF ROBERT CUSHMAN TO THE LEYDEN LEADERS, LONDON
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">(Sunday, June 11/21, 1620.)

    Salutations, &amp;c.  I received your letter [of May 31/June 10] yesterday,
    by John Turner, with another ye same day from Amsterdam by Mr. W.
    savouring of ye place whenc it came.  And indeed the many discouragements
    I find her,[London] togeather with ye demurrs and retirings ther,[Leyden]
    had made me to say, I would give up my accounts to John Carver, &amp; at his
    comeing aquainte him fully with all courses, and so leave it quite, with
    only ye pore cloaths on my back. But gathering up my selfe by further
    consideration, I resolved yet to make one triall more, and to acquainte
    Mr. Weston with ye fainted state of our bussines; and though he hath been
    much discontented at some thing amongst us of late, which hath made him
    often say, that save for his promise, he would not meadle at all with ye
    bussines any more, yet considering how farr we were plunged into maters,
    &amp; how it stood both on our credits &amp; undoing, at ye last he gathered up
    him selfe a litle more, &amp; coming to me 2. hours after, he tould me he
    would not yet leave it.  And so advising togeather we resolved to hire a
    ship, and have tooke liking of one till Monday, about 60. laste, for a
    greater we cannot gett, excepte it be tow great; but a fine ship it is.
    And seeing our neer freinds ther are so streite lased, we hope to assure
    her without troubling them any further; and if ye ship fale too small, it
    fitteth well yt such as stumble at strawes already, may rest them ther a
    while, least worse blocks come in ye way ere 7. years be ended.  If you
    had beaten this bussines so throuly a month agoe, and write to us as now
    you doe, we could thus have done much more conveniently.  But it is as it
    is; I hope our freinds they, if they be quitted of ye ship hire, will be
    indusced to venture ye more.  All yt I now require is yt salt and netts
    may ther be boughte, and for all ye rest we will here provid it; yet if
    that will not be, let them but stand for it a month or tow, and we will
    take order to pay it all.  Let Mr. Reinholds tarie ther, and bring ye
    ship to Southampton.  We have hired another pilote here, one Mr. Clarke,
    who went last year to Virginia with a ship of kine.

You shall here distinctly by John Turner, who I thinke shall come hence
on tewsday night.  I had thought to have come with him, to have answered
to my complaints; but I shal lerne to pass litle for their censurs; and
if I had more minde to goe &amp; dispute &amp; expostulate with them, then I have
care of this waightie bussines, I were like them who live by clamours &amp;
jangling.  But neither my mind nor my body is at libertie to doe much,
for I am fettered with bussines, and had rather study to be quiet, then
to make answer to their exceptions.  If men be set on it, let them beat
ye eair; I hope such as are my sinceire freinds will not thinke but I can
give some reason of my actions.  But of your mistaking aboute ye mater,
     &amp; other things tending to this bussines, I shall nexte informe you
more distinctly.  Mean space entreate our freinds not to be too bussie in
answering matters, before they know them.  If I doe such things as I
canot give reasons for, it is like you have sett a foole aboute your
bussines, and so turne ye reproofe to your selves, &amp; send an other, and
let me come againe to my Combes.  But setting aside my naturall
infirmities, I refuse not to have my cause judged, both of God, &amp; all
indifferent men; and when we come togeather I shall give accounte of my
actions hear.  The Lord, who judgeth justly without respect of persons,
see into ye equitie of my cause, and give us quiet, peacable, and patient
minds, in all these turmoils, and sanctifie unto us all crosses
whatsoever.  And so I take my leave of you all, in all love &amp; affection.
         I hope we shall gett all hear ready in 14. days.
                       Your pore brother,

<pre xml:space="preserve">
My dear freind &amp; brother, whom with yours I alwaise remember in my best
affection, and whose wellfare I shall never cease to comend to God by my
best &amp; most earnest praires.  You doe throwly understand by our generall
letters ye estate of things hear, which indeed is very pitifull;
espetialy by wante of shiping, and not seeing means lickly, much less
certaine, of having it provided; though withall ther be great want of
money &amp; means to doe needfull things.  Mr. [Edward] Pickering, you know
before this, will not defray a peny hear; though Robert Cushman presumed
of I know not how many 100li. from him, &amp; I know not whom. Yet it seems
strange yt we should be put to him to receive both his &amp; his partners
[William Greene&rsquo;s] adventer, and yet Mr. Weston write unto him, yt in
regard of it, he hath drawne upon him a 100li. more.  But they is in this
some misterie, as indeed it seems ther is in ye whole course.  Besids,
wheras diverse are to pay in some parts of their moneys yet behinde, they
refuse to doe it, till they see shiping provided, or a course taken for
it.  Neither doe I thinke is ther a man hear would pay anything, if he
had againe his money in his purse.  You know right well we depended on
Mr. Weston alone, and upon such means as he would procure for this
commone bussines; and when we had in hand an other course with ye
Dutchmen, broke it of at his motion, and upon ye conditions by him
shortly after propounded. He did this in his love I know, but things
appeare not answerable from him hitherto.  That he should have first have
put in his moneys, is thought by many to have been but fitt, but yt I can
well excuse, he being a marchante and haveing use of it to his benefite;
whereas others, if it had been in their hands, would have consumed it.
But yt he should not but have had either shipping ready before this time,
or at least certaine means, and course, and ye same knowne to us for it,
or have taken other order otherwise, cannot in my conscience be excused.
I have heard yt wen he hath been moved in the bussines, he hath put it of
from him selfe, and referred it to ye others; and would come to Georg
Morton [in London] &amp; enquire news of him aboute things, as if he had
scarce been some accessarie unto it. Wlether he hath failed of some helps
from others which he expected, and so be not well able to goe through
with things, or whether he hath feared least you should be ready too
soone &amp; so encrease ye charge of shiping above yt is meete, or whether he
hath thought by withhoulding to put us upon straits, thinking yt therby
Mr. Brewer and Mr. Pickering would be drawne by importunitie to doe more,
or what other misterie is in it, we know not; but sure we are yt things
are not answerable to such an occasion.  Mr. Weston maks himselfe mery
with our endeavors aboute buying a ship, [the SPEEDWELL], but we have
done nothing in this but with good reason, as I am perswaded, nor yet
that I know in any thing els, save in those tow: ye one, that we imployed
Robart Cushman, who is known (though a good man &amp; of spetiall abilities
in his kind, yet) most unfitt to deale for other by reason of his
singularitie, and too great indifferancie for any conditions, and for (to
speak truly) that we have had nothing from him but termes &amp; presumptions.
The other, yt we have so much relyed, by implicite faith as it were, upon
generalities, without seeing ye perticuler course &amp; means for so waghtie
an affaire set down unto us.  For shiping, Mr. Weston, it should seeme,
is set upon hireing, which yet I wish he may presently effecte; but I see
litle hope of help from hence if so it be.  Of Mr. [Thomas] Brewer, you
know what to expecte.  I doe not thinke Mr. Pickering will ingage,
excepte in ye course of buying [ships?] in former letters specified.
Aboute ye conditions, you have our reason for our judgments of what is
agreed.  And let this spetially be borne in minde, yt the greatest pane
of ye Collonie is like to be imployed constantly, not upon dressing they
perticuler land &amp; building houses, but upon fishing, trading, &amp;c.  So as
ye land &amp; house will be but a trifell for advantage to ye adventurers,
and yet the devission of it a great discouragmente to ye planters, who
would with singuler care make it comfortable with borowed houres from
their sleep.  The same consideration of comone imploymente constantly by
the most is a good reason not to have ye 2, daies in a week denyed ye few
planters for private use, which yet is subordinate to comone good.
Consider also how much unfite that you &amp; your liks must serve a new
prentishipe of 7. years, and not a daies freedome from taske.  Send me
word what persons are to goe, who of usefull faculties, &amp; how many, &amp;
perticulerly of every thing.  I know you wante not a minde.  I am sorie
you have not been at London all this while, but ye provissions could not
want you.  Time will suffer me to write no more; fare, you &amp; yours well
allways in ye Lord, in whom I rest.

      VII<br /> THE LETTER OF THE PLANTERS TO THE<br /> MERCHANT ADVENTURERS (FROM
      SOUTHAMPTON)
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

 Aug. 3.  Ano.  1620.


    Beloved freinds, sory we are that ther should be occasion of writing at
    all unto you, partly because we ever expected to see ye most of you hear,
    but espetially because ther should any difference at all be conceived
    betweene us.  But seing it faleth out that we cannot conferr togeather,
    we thinke it meete (though brefly) to show you ye just cause &amp; reason of
    our differing from those articles last made by Robert Cushman, without
    our comission or knowledg.


And though he might propound good ends to himselfe, yet it no way
justifies his doing it.  Our maine diference is in ye 5.&amp; 9. article,
concerning ye deviding or holding of house and lands; the injoying
whereof some of your selves well know, was one spetiall motive, amongst
many other, to provoke us to goe.  This was thought so reasonable, yt
when ye greatest of you in adventure (whom we have much cause to
respecte), when he propounded conditions to us freely of his owne
accorde, he set this downe for one; a coppy wherof we have sent unto you,
with some additions then added by us; which being liked on both sids, and
a day set for ye paimente of moneys, those in Holland paid in theirs.
After yt, Robert Cushman, Mr. [John] Pierce, &amp; Mr. [Christopher] Martine,
brought them into a better forme, &amp; write them in a booke now extante;
and upon Robarts [Cushmans] shewing them and delivering Mr. [William]
Mullins a coppy thereof under his hand (which we have), he payed in his
money.  And we of Holland had never seen other before our coming to
Hamton, but only as one got for him selfe a private coppy of them; upon
sight wherof we manyfested uter dislike, but had put of our estats &amp; were
ready to come, and therfore was too late to rejecte ye vioage.  Judge
therefore we beseech you indifferently of things, and if a faulte have
bene comited, lay it where it is, &amp; not upon us, who have more cause to
stand for ye one, then you have for ye other.  We never gave Robart
Cushman comission to make any one article for us, but only sent him to
receive moneys upon articles before agreed on, and to further ye
provissions till John Carver came, and to assiste him in it.  Yet since
you conceive your selves wronged as well as we, we thought meete to add a
branch to ye end of our 9. article, as will allmost heale that wound of
it selfe, which you conceive to be in it.  But that it may appeare to all
men yt we are not lovers of our selves only, but desire also ye good &amp;
inriching of our freinds who have adventured your moneys with our
persons, we have added our last article to ye rest, promising you againe
by leters in ye behalfe of the whole company, that if large profits
should not arise within ye 7. years, yt we will continue togeather longer
with you, if ye Lord give a blessing.&mdash;[Bradford adds in a note, &ldquo;It is
well for them yt this was not accepted.&rdquo;]&mdash;This we hope is sufficente to
satisfie any in this case, espetialy freinds, since we are asured yt if
the whole charge was devided into 4. parts, 3. of them will not stand
upon it, nether doe regarde it, &amp;c.  We are in shuch a streate at
presente, as we are forced to sell away 60li. worth of our provissions to
cleare ye Haven [Southampton] &amp; withall put our selves upon great
extremities, scarce haveing any butter, no oyle, not a sole to mend a
shoe, nor every man a sword to his side, wanting many muskets, much
armoure, etc. And yet we are willing to expose our selves to shuch
eminente dangers as are like to insue, &amp; trust to ye good providence of
God, rather then his name &amp; truth should be evill spoken of for us.  Thus
saluting all of you in love, and beseeching ye Lord to give a blesing to
our endeavore, and keepe all our harts in ye bonds of peace &amp; love, we
take leave &amp; rest,
                         Yours, &amp;c

      VIII THE LETTER OF ROBERT CUSHMAN (FROM SOUTHAMPTON) TO EDWARD SOUTHWORTH
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    To his loving friend Ed[ward] S[outhworth] at Henige House, in ye Duks
    Place [London], these, &amp;c.

                         Dartmouth [Thursday] Aug. 17, [Anno 1620.]

    Loving friend, my most kind remembrance to you &amp; your wife, with loving
    E. M. &amp;c.  whom in this world I never looke to see againe.  For besids ye
    eminente dangers of this viage, which are no less then deadly, an
    infirmitie of body Hath seased me, which will not in all licelyhoode
    leave me till death.  What to call it I know not, but it it is a bundle
    of lead, as it were, crushing my harte more &amp; more these 14. days, as
    that allthough I doe ye acctions of a liveing man, yet I am but as dead;
    but ye will of God be done.  Our pinass [the SPEEDWELL] will not cease
    leaking, els I thinke we had been halfe way at Virginia, our viage hither
    hath been as full of crosses, as our, selves have been of crokednes.  We
    put in hear to trime her, &amp; I thinke, as others also, if we had stayed at
    sea but 3. or 4. howers more, shee would have sunke right downe.  And
    though she was twice trimed at Hamton, yet now shee is open and lekie as
    a seine; and ther was a borde, a man might have puld of with his fingers,
    2 foote longe, wher ye water came in as at a mole hole.  We lay at Hamton
    7. days, in fair weather, waiting for her, and now we lye hear waiting
    for her in as faire a wind as can blowe, and so have done these 4. days,
    and are like to lye 4. more, and by yt time ye wind will happily turne as
    it did at Hamton.  Our victualls will be halfe eaten up, I thinke, before
    we goe from the coaste of England, and if our viage last longe, we shall
    not have a months victialls when we come in ye countrie.  Near 700li.
    hath bene bestowed at Hamton upon what I know not.  Mr. Martin saith he
    neither can nor will give any accounte of it, and if he be called upon
    for accounts he crieth out of unthankfulness for his paines &amp; care, that
    we are susspitious of him, and flings away, and will end nothing.  Also
    he so insulteh over our poore people with shuch scorne and contempte, as
    if they were not good enough to wipe his shoes.  It would break your hart
    to see his dealing, and ye mourning of our people.  They complaine to me,
    &amp; alass!  I can doe nothing for them; if I speake to him, he flies in my
    face, as mutinous, and saith no complaints shall be heard or received but
    by him selfe, and saith they are forwarde, &amp; waspish, discontented
    people, &amp; I doe ill to hear them.  Ther are others yt would lose all they
    have put in, or make satisfaction for what they have had, that they might
    departe; but he will not hear them, nor suffer them to goe ashore, least
    they should rune away. The sailors also are so offended at his ignorante
    bouldnes, in medling &amp; controuling in things he knows not what belongs
    too, as yt some threaten to misscheefe him, others say they will leave ye
    shipe &amp; goe their way.  But at ye best this cometh of it, yt he maks him
    selfe a scorne &amp; laughing stock unto them.  As for Mr. Weston, excepte
    grace doe greatly swaye with him, he will hate us ten times more then
    ever he loved us, for not confirming ye conditions.  But now, since some
    pinches have taken them, they begine to reveile ye trueth, and say Mr.
    Robinson was in ye falte who charged them never to consente to those
    conditions, nor chuse me into office, but indeede apointed them to chose
    them they did chose.  But he and they will rue too late, they may now
    see, &amp; all be ashamed when it is too late, that they were so ignorante,
    yea, &amp; so inordinate in their courses.  I am sure as they were resolved
    not to seale those conditions, I was not so resolute at Hamton to have
    left ye whole bussines, excepte they would seale them, and better ye
    vioage to have bene broken of then, then to have brought such miserie to
    our selves, dishonour to God, &amp; detrimente to our loving freinds, as now
    it is like to doe.  4. or 5. of ye cheefe of them which came from Leyden,
    came resolved never to goe on those conditions.  And Mr. Martine, he said
    he never received no money on those conditions, he was not beholden to ye
    marchants, for a pine [pennie], they were bloudsuckers, &amp; I know not
    what.  Simple man, he indeed never made any conditions wth the marchants,
    nor ever spake with them.

But did all that money flie to Hamton, or was it his owne?  Who will goe
lay out money so rashly &amp; lavishly as he did, and never know how he comes
by it, or on what conditions?  I tould him of ye alteration longe
agoe, &amp; he was contente; but now he dominires, &amp; said I had betrayed them
into ye hands of slaves; he is not beholden to them, he can set out 2
ships him selfe to a viage.  When, good man?  He hath but 50li. in, &amp; if
he should give up his accounts he would not have a penie left him,
&mdash;[&ldquo;This  was  found  true  afterwards.]   W[illiam]  B"[radford]]&mdash;as I
am persuaded, &amp;c.  Freind, if ever we make a plantation, God works a
mirakle; especially considering how scante we shall be of victualls, and
most of all ununited amongst our selves, &amp; devoyd of good tutors and
regimente.  Violence will break all.  Wher is ye meek &amp; humble spirite of
Moyses? &amp; of Nehemiah who reedified ye wals of Jerusalem, and ye state of
Israell?  Is not ye sound of Rehoboams braggs daly hear amongst us?  Have
not ye philosophers and all wise men observed yt, even in setled comone
welths, violente governours bring either them selves, or people, or
boath, to ruine; how much more in ye raising of comone wealths, when ye
mortar is yet scarce tempered yt should bind ye wales [walls].  If I
should write to you of all things which promiscuously forerune our ruine,
I should over charge my weake head and greeve your tender hart; only
this, I pray you prepare for evill tidings of us every day.  But pray for
us instantly, it may be ye Lord will be yet entreated one way or other to
make for us.  I see not in reason how we shall escape even ye gasping of
hunger starved persons; but God can doe much, &amp; his will be done.  It is
better for me to dye, then now for me to bear it, which I doe daly, &amp;
expect it howerly; haveing received ye sentance of death, both within me
&amp; with out me.  Poore William Ring &amp; my selfe doe strive who shall be
meate first for ye fishes; but we looke for a glorious resurrection,
knowing Christ Jesus after ye flesh no more, but looking unto ye joye yt
is before us, we will endure all these things and accounte them light in
comparison of ye joye we hope for.  Remember me in all love to our
freinds as if I named them, whose praiers I desire earnestly, &amp; wish
againe to see, but not till I can with more comforte looke them in ye
face.  The Lord give us that true comforte which none can take from us.
I had a desire to make a breefe relation of our estate to some freind.
I doubte not but your wisdome will teach you seasonably to utter things
as here after you shall be called to it.  That which I have writen is
treue, &amp; many things more which I have for borne.  I write it as upon my
life, and last confession in England.  What is of use to be spoken of
presently, you may speake of it, and what is fitt to conceile, conceall.
Pass by my weake maner, for my head is weake, and my body feeble, ye Lord
make me strong in him, and keepe both you &amp; yours.
                              Your loving freind,

    <h2>
      ADDENDA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Governor Winslow, in his &ldquo;Hypocrisie Unmasked&rdquo; (pp. 89,90), indicates that
      the representatives of the Leyden congregation (Cushman and Carver) sought
      the First (or London) Virginia Company as early as 1613. It is beyond
      doubt that preliminary steps toward securing the favor, both of the King
      and others, were taken as early as 1617, and that the Wincob Patent was
      granted in their interest, June 9/19, 1619. But the Leyden people were but
      little advanced by the issue of this Patent. They became discouraged, and
      began early in 1620 (perhaps earlier) negotiations with the Dutch, which
      were in progress when, at the instance of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Thomas
      Weston undertook (February 2/12, April 1/11, 1620) to secure the Leyden
      party, avowedly for the London Virginia Company, but really for its rival,
      the Second Virginia Company, soon to be merged in the &ldquo;Council of Affairs
      for New England.&rdquo; It was then, and under these influences, that the Leyden
      leaders &ldquo;broke off,&rdquo; as Bradford puts it, their negotiations with the
      Dutch authorities, who, however, apparently about the same time,
      determined to reject their propositions. While the renewal of the Leyden
      leaders&rsquo; negotiations, through Weston, were, &ldquo;on their face&rdquo; (and so far
      as the Pilgrims were concerned), with the First Virginia Company, with
      whom, through Sir Edwin Sandys and other friends, their original efforts
      were made, they were, as stated, subverted by Gorges&rsquo;s plans and Weston&rsquo;s
      cooperation, in the interest of the Second Virginia Company. The Merchant
      Adventurers were represented, in the direct negotiations for the Patent
      only, by John Pierce, who, at that time, was apparently dealing honestly,
      and was not, so far as appears, in Gorges&rsquo;s confidence, though later he
      proved a traitor and a consummate rascal, albeit he always acted,
      apparently, alone. The so-called &ldquo;Pierce Patent&rdquo; (which displaced the
      Wincob) was rendered worthless by the landing of the Pilgrims north of 41
      deg. north latitude. The third Patent (Pierce&rsquo;s second) was from the
      Council for New England to Pierce, for the colonists, but was exchanged by
      him for a &ldquo;deed-pole&rdquo; to himself, though at last surrendered to the colony
      under stress.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
